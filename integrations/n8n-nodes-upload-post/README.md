### Status & History Actions
- **Get Upload Status**: Check the status/result of an async upload by `request_id`.
  - Parameters: Request ID.
- **Get Upload History**: List past uploads.
  - Parameters: Page (default 1), Limit (default 20). Limit can be 20, 50, or 100.
- **Get Analytics**: Retrieve aggregated profile analytics.
  - Parameters: Profile Username, Platforms (required — at least one), Facebook Page ID (required when Facebook is selected), LinkedIn Page URN (optional).
  - Supported: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube. Analytics are not available for Bluesky, Discord, Google Business or Telegram.
- **Get Post Analytics**: Per-post metrics for an upload, by `request_id`.
  - Parameters: Request ID, Platform (optional filter).
  - On TikTok, `post_metrics` also carries `retention`, `impression_sources`, `audience_types`, `new_followers`, `reach` and the watch times.
- **Get Post Analytics by Platform ID**: Per-post metrics for a post published outside Upload-Post.
  - Parameters: Platform Post ID, Platform, Profile Username.
- **Get Cached Post Analytics**: Replays per-post metrics already fetched, instead of querying the platforms again, so it is not subject to the live analytics rate limit (100 requests / 5 minutes). Only contains posts previously fetched through a live per-post endpoint; there is no background refresh, so captured_at is the last time that post was read live.
  - Parameters: Profile Username (required), Platform (optional filter), Limit (default 50, max 200), Cursor, Since / Until (`YYYY-MM-DD`, defaults to the last 30 days).
  - Values are only as fresh as your last live read — check `captured_at` on each post. Use **Get Post Analytics** for a just-published post and this operation for bulk or historical reads.
  - Paginate by passing the `next_cursor` from the previous response as `Cursor` while `has_more` is true.
  - Supported: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit, Threads, TikTok, YouTube. X (Twitter) is not cached.
- **Get Total Impressions**: Impressions aggregated across connected platforms.
  - Parameters: Profile Username, Period or Start/End Date, Platforms, Breakdown.
- **Get Platform Metrics**: Lists which metrics each platform exposes.
- **Get Reddit Detailed Posts**: Detailed Reddit posts with full media information.
  - Parameters: Profile Username.
- **Get Media**: List published media for a connected network.
- **Get Google Business Locations**: List locations for a Google Business Profile.
- **Get TikTok Trending Music / Search TikTok Music / Get TikTok Locations / Get TikTok Publishing Settings**: TikTok discovery helpers (music IDs, location IDs, creator capabilities).

### Post Actions
- **Retry Post**: Re-enqueue failed platforms of an upload without re-uploading media (`request_id` or `job_id`).
- **Unpublish Post**: Delete a live post. Not available for Instagram, TikTok or Threads.
- **Edit Post**: Update caption/metadata on a live post.
- **Repost**: Repost on LinkedIn or X.
- **Save Pin**: Save a Pinterest pin to a board.

### Scheduled Posts
- **List Scheduled Posts**: Lists future scheduled jobs.
- **Cancel Scheduled Post**: Cancels a scheduled job by its Job ID.
- **Edit Scheduled Post**: Updates a scheduled job (e.g., new scheduled date/time).
  - Tip: You can schedule any Upload action by providing the `Scheduled Date` during upload.

### Platform Selectors (Dynamic)
- **Facebook Pages**: Dynamic picker for Facebook pages, or enter ID via expression. Required for all Facebook operations.
- **LinkedIn Pages**: Dynamic picker for organization pages with "Me (Personal Profile)" option, or enter ID via expression.
- **Pinterest Boards**: Dynamic picker for Pinterest boards, or enter ID via expression. Required for all Pinterest operations.

### User Actions (incl. JWT for custom platform integration)
- ⚠️ **JWT endpoints are only needed if you integrate Upload-Post into your own platform** and want end-users to link their social accounts via your UI.
- **List Users**: Retrieve Upload-Post profiles created under your API key.
- **Create User**: Create a new user profile.
  - Parameters: New User Identifier (username).
- **Delete User**: Delete an existing user profile.
  - Parameters: Username to delete.
- **Generate JWT (for platform integration)**: Generate a connection URL (JWT) for a given profile so the user can link social accounts.
  - Parameters: User Identifier, optional redirect URL, logo image URL, redirect button text, platform restrictions, calendar options, connect title/description, language, UI labels.
  - **Language**: forces the connection page language. Supported: English, Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Polish, Turkish. Leave on Auto-Detect to use the visitor's browser language (falls back to English).
  - **UI Labels**: white-label overrides for individual connection page texts, as key/value pairs (sent as `ui_labels`). The key is an i18n dot-path such as `connect.connectButton`, the value the replacement string. The API accepts up to 100 entries, keys matching `^[a-zA-Z0-9_.]+$` and values of up to 300 characters, and rejects the request otherwise.
- **Validate JWT (for platform integration)**: Validate a connection token from your backend.
  - Parameters: JWT token (password field).
  - The API response is returned as-is; its `profile` object also carries the `ui_labels` map configured for that profile.

### Comment Actions
The comment endpoints are shaped like the rest of the API: **one endpoint per question, with a `platform` parameter** that says which connected network is being asked. There is no endpoint per social network.
- **Get Post Comments**: Comments on a post from the network given by `Platform` (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn or TikTok).
  - Parameters: User Identifier, Platform, Post ID or URL, Comment ID (optional).
  - Instagram and Facebook accept the media ID or the post URL, YouTube the video ID, LinkedIn the post URN, TikTok the video ID. TikTok has no URL lookup, so pasting a URL fails with a descriptive error instead of an upstream one.
  - Fill **Comment ID** to get the replies to that comment instead of the top-level comments of the post. It is the same question with one parameter more, not a separate operation.
- **Comment Action**: Moderate one comment — hide, unhide, like, unlike, pin or unpin it.
  - Parameters: User Identifier, Platform, Comment ID, Action, Post ID (shown only when it is needed).
  - Each action carries its own inverse, so there is no separate toggle: `hide`/`unhide`, `like`/`unlike`, `pin`/`unpin`.
  - **Post ID** is required for `hide`, `unhide`, `pin` and `unpin`, and is never sent for `like`/`unlike` — the API rejects a like that carries a post. The node checks it before the request leaves n8n.
  - TikTok is the network that answers this today, and its profile needs the `comments` capability (see the `capabilities` array returned by **List Users**); an account connected before that capability existed has to reconnect TikTok.
- **Private Reply to Comment**: DM the author of a comment. Instagram only.
- **Public Reply to Comment**: Public reply under the comment. Instagram only.
- **Create Comment**: Top-level comment or reply (Instagram replies only; TikTok always needs the video ID).
- **Delete Comment**: Delete a comment you own or that is on your post.

### Insight Actions
Two more questions with a `platform` parameter, not two TikTok endpoints. A network that cannot answer a question replies with `platform_not_supported` and the list of the ones that can; today that network is TikTok, whose profile needs the `profile_analytics` capability (see the `capabilities` array returned by **List Users**).
- **Get Audience**: Who follows the profile and when they are around — audience countries, cities, age brackets and genders, followers online per hour, daily followers gained and lost, profile actions and the bio.
  - Parameters: User Identifier, Platform, Start Date, End Date, Benchmark Category (all optional except the first two).
  - Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`. The window is clamped **by the server**: 60 days at most, and End Date always below today. A wider range is trimmed, not rejected, so the node sends it as typed.
  - Filling **Benchmark Category** adds a `benchmark` object with that niche's averages (comments, engagement rate, follower count and growth, likes, shares, video count and views) next to the account's own numbers. The 25 accepted values come back in `benchmark_categories` on every response, so filling a picker needs no extra call.
  - Use this to know *who* the audience is and *when* to post; use **Get Post Analytics** for how a given post did.
- **Get Suggestions**: What to write about — hashtags or the searches people run around a seed word.
  - Parameters: User Identifier, Platform, Type (`hashtags` / `keywords`), Query, Country Code, Language.
  - `Type = hashtags` answers with `hashtags: [{ name, view_count }]`; `Type = keywords` answers with `keywords: [...]`. One endpoint, told apart by `type`, not by operation.

Refer to the [Upload Post API Documentation](https://docs.upload-post.com) for detailed information on parameters and platform requirements.

### Waiting for asynchronous uploads

Some uploads are processed asynchronously and the API returns immediately with a `request_id`. This happens when:
- You enable "Upload Asynchronously" in the node, or
- The upload exceeds the server's synchronous wait window, in which case the API switches to async mode automatically.

Leaving "Upload Asynchronously" enabled is recommended. Turning it off holds the HTTP connection open for the whole upload, which makes a proxy or execution timeout — and therefore a retry — more likely.

You have two ways to handle this in n8n:

1) Best-effort polling inside the node
- In Upload operations (Photos/Video/Text), enable "Wait for Completion".
- Configure "Poll Interval (Seconds)" (default 10) and "Timeout (Seconds)".
- The node sleeps between checks (using n8n's `sleep`) and calls `GET /api/uploadposts/status?request_id=...` until success/failure or timeout.
- Note: This does not guarantee completion in hosted environments with strict execution limits.

2) Workflow-level polling (recommended for reliability)
- Use the Upload operation, read `request_id` from its output.
- Add a Wait node (e.g., 10s), then call "Get Upload Status" passing the `request_id`.
- Loop with an IF node until the status is final (success/failed) or a max attempts limit is reached.

### Duplicate posts and retries

Every upload sends an `Idempotency-Key`. The API collapses two uploads carrying the same key within a 24-hour window into a single post, so a retried upload does not publish twice.

The key is derived from the workflow execution, the node and the item index, so it stays the same when n8n's "Retry On Fail" re-runs the node, and changes when you genuinely start a new execution. Set the "Idempotency Key" field yourself only if you drive retries from outside n8n and need to control the key.

If you saw duplicate posts on an older version of this node, upgrade: versions before 0.1.51 sent no key at all, and a node-level retry after a network timeout would publish the post a second time.

### Platform-Specific Options

#### Facebook
- **Page Selection**: Dynamic picker for Facebook pages (required for all operations).
- **Media Type (Video)**: Reels or Stories.
- **Video State**: Published or Draft.
- **Link (Text)**: URL for link preview in text posts.

#### LinkedIn
- **Page Selection**: Dynamic picker for organization pages ("Me" option for personal profiles).
- **Visibility (Photos/Video)**: Public, Connections, Logged In, Container (video only).
- **Video Description**: User commentary for video posts.

#### Instagram
- **Media Type**: Image (feed photos), Stories, Reels (video).
- **Video Options**: Share to feed, collaborators (comma-separated usernames), cover URL, audio name, user tags (comma-separated), location ID, thumb offset.
- **Photo Cover Index**: Which photo to use as cover (0-based index).

#### TikTok
- **Photo Options**: Auto-add music, disable comments, photo cover index, brand content toggles (paid partnerships/third-party brands vs own business).
- **Video Options**: Privacy level (Public/Mutual Friends/Followers/Self), disable duet/stitch/comments, cover timestamp (ms), brand content toggles, AI-generated content flag, post mode (Direct Post/Media Upload).
- **Brand Content**: Separate toggles for paid partnerships and own business promotion.

#### TikTok Advanced Video Options

> **Capability-gated.** `GET /api/uploadposts/users` returns a `capabilities`
> array on each TikTok account (`music`, `location`, `cover_image`,
> `cover_timestamp`, `draft`, `photo_privacy`, `video_privacy`,
> `inbox_fallback`, `profile_analytics`). If the connection does not declare the capability an option
> needs, the API ignores that field, the post still publishes and the response
> includes a per-field warning — reconnect the TikTok account to enable it.
> These options are only sent when actually filled in, so leaving them at their
> defaults keeps the previous behaviour.

- **Music** (`music`): TikTok Music ID — the `id` of a track returned by `GET /api/uploadposts/tiktok/music/trending` or `GET /api/uploadposts/tiktok/music/search` (not its `commercial_music_id`) — plus music volume (0-100) and music start/end offsets in ms. The Music ID works on **video and photo** posts; the volume and the offsets are video-only, because TikTok's photo contract takes the track id alone.

  To pick a track by name inside a workflow, put an **HTTP Request** node before
  this one calling
  `GET https://api.upload-post.com/api/uploadposts/tiktok/music/search?profile=<profile>&q=<song or artist>`
  with the header `Authorization: Apikey <your key>`, and feed `tracks[0].id`
  into TikTok Music ID. It also accepts `genre`, `country_code`, `date_range`
  and `limit`. Note that TikTok has **no music search endpoint**: the search
  runs over the trending charts Upload-Post caches per genre/country/period, so
  it finds trending tracks, not TikTok's entire catalogue.
- **Original Sound Volume**: Volume (0-100) of the video's own audio when music is added. Keep it above 0 so the original audio is not muted. Music volume and original sound volume are only sent when a Music ID is set.
- **Location** (`location`): TikTok Location ID plus TikTok Location Name — TikTok requires both together. Works on video and photo posts.
- **Cover Image URL** (`cover_image`): Custom cover image, takes priority over the cover timestamp. Video only.
- **Is AI Generated**: AI-generated content disclosure. Works on video and photo posts.
- **Upload to Draft** (`draft`): Sends the video to TikTok drafts instead of publishing; TikTok then ignores the rest of the post settings. Video only.

> **Privacy level on TikTok.** `privacy_level` is accepted on video and photo
> uploads alike (capabilities `video_privacy` / `photo_privacy`), but **TikTok
> decides per account which values are available**: a private account is offered
> Followers / Mutual Friends / Self Only and has no Public. Asking for one the
> account does not have fails with `tiktok_privacy_unavailable`, and the error
> lists the ones it does have. The **Account Default** option on the TikTok
> Privacy Level (Video) field sends nothing and lets TikTok apply the account's
> own setting — the only choice guaranteed to work on every account, and the
> default for new nodes. Photo posts default to Public. To pick a value up front,
> query `GET /api/uploadposts/tiktok/settings?profile=<profile>` from an HTTP
> Request node and read `privacy_level_options`.
