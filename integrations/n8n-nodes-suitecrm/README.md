# n8n-nodes-suitecrm-community

A generic n8n node to operate with any SuiteCRM (7.x+) module via the official JSON API.

Supports CRUD operations, dynamic module and field discovery (including custom fields), advanced filtering, pagination, and relationship retrieval.

---

## Features

- **Full CRUD** – Create, read, update, and delete any SuiteCRM module
- **Dynamic discovery** – Auto-lists modules and fields, including custom fields
- **Advanced filtering** – Filter records using operators, custom fields, pagination
- **Relationship handling** – Retrieve, link, and unlink related records from any entity
- **Polling trigger** – React to new or updated records without touching the CRM instance
- **AI agent tool** – Use the main node as a tool from an n8n AI Agent
- **OAuth2 authentication** – Native SuiteCRM client credentials flow
- **Robust error handling** – Clear errors and maintainable structure

---

## Installation

**Recommended:** install from the n8n UI under **Settings → Community Nodes**, entering the package name `n8n-nodes-suitecrm-community`.

**Self-hosted via CLI:** install it into your n8n instance:

```bash
npm install n8n-nodes-suitecrm-community
```

Then restart n8n. See the [n8n community nodes documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) for details.

## Usage

### 1. Credentials

- Create credentials in n8n of type **SuiteCRM API**
- Fill in your SuiteCRM domain, Client ID, and Client Secret  
  *(see SuiteCRM → Admin → OAuth2 Clients)*

### 2. Node Configuration

- **Module:** Auto-discovered list from your API
- **Operation:** Choose from Get All, Get One, Create, Update, Delete, Get Relationships, Link Record, Unlink Record
- **Data mode:** Define Create/Update payloads field by field, or with raw JSON
- **Parameters:** Filters, IDs, pagination, or JSON payloads depending on operation

### 3. Example – Create a Contact

Input data:
```json
{
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email1": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

### 4. Polling Trigger

The **SuiteCRM Trigger** node polls the selected modules and emits one item per new or updated record. Events are limited to `created` and `updated` (deletion detection is not supported). Cadence is configurable: every poll, every N hours/days, or a 5-field cron expression.

### 5. AI Agent Tool

The main SuiteCRM node can be used as a tool by n8n's **AI Agent**. Community packages are only exposed as tools when the instance is started with:

```bash
N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE=true
```

Without that environment variable the node does not appear as a tool (the trigger node is never usable as a tool).

#### Letting the model fill in the data

The node ships with `$fromAI()` defaults for its dynamic parameters, so the model controls them out of the box:

- **`data`** – the record payload (Create / Update, Raw JSON mode)
- **`id`** – the record ID (Get One, Update, Delete, Get Relationships)
- **`limit`** – the page size (Get All with Return All disabled)

`Module` and `Operation` stay fixed on the node: pin one module/operation per workflow (e.g. `Contacts` + `Create`), and the agent supplies `data` on each call. You can also enable/disable `$fromAI()` per field with the **"Defined automatically by the model"** button in the node editor.

#### Using it through an MCP server

Because the node is `usableAsTool`, n8n's **MCP Server** trigger exposes it automatically to any MCP client. Connect the node as a tool in an MCP Server workflow, point your client at the server's URL, and the model can call the same operations directly (e.g. `Get All` exposes a `limit` parameter, `Create` exposes a required `data` payload).

## Supported Operations

| Operation         | Description                                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Get All          | Fetch records with optional filters & paging  |
| Get One          | Retrieve a single record by ID                |
| Create           | Add a new record (field mode or JSON payload) |
| Update           | Modify a record (field mode or JSON payload)  |
| Delete           | Remove a record by ID                         |
| Get Relationships| Fetch related records of a module by ID       |
| Link Record      | Link an existing record to another            |
| Unlink Record    | Break a link without deleting either record   |

---

## Requirements

- n8n 1.x or newer
- SuiteCRM 7.x+ with API and OAuth2 enabled
- SuiteCRM **≥ 7.11.4** is required for the **Unlink Record** operation (DELETE relationship endpoint)
- All modules and fields are fetched dynamically
- For 1:N relations, set the "parent" ID on the child (SuiteCRM logic)
- Tested against SuiteCRM v7+ JSON API

---

## Troubleshooting

### "The specified package could not be loaded" after upgrading

n8n caches loaded node classes. When upgrading from v2.2.7 or earlier, clear the cache and reinstall:

**Docker:**
```bash
docker exec -it <container> sh -c "rm -rf /home/node/.n8n/nodes/node_modules/* /home/node/.n8n/nodes/package.json"
docker restart <container>
```

**npm / local:**
```bash
rm -rf ~/.n8n/nodes/node_modules/*
rm -f ~/.n8n/nodes/package.json
```

Then reinstall from **Settings → Community Nodes**.

### Node does not appear as an AI Agent tool

Add this environment variable to your n8n instance:
```bash
N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE=true
```

### Other issues

- `access_token` missing → Check credentials or OAuth2 setup
- `405 Method Not Allowed` → PATCH may not be enabled in your SuiteCRM
- After upgrading n8n itself, community nodes may need to be reinstalled
- Check `docker logs <container>` for detailed error messages
