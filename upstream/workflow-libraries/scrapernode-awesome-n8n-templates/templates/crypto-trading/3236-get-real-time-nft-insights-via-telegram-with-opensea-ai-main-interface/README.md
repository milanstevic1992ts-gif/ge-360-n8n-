## Description

**Track NFT market trends, collections, and trades in real time—directly from Telegram!** This master workflow integrates the **OpenSea API**, **GPT-4o-mini AI**, and **Telegram**, allowing users to request natural-language NFT analytics and receive structured insights instantly.

Whether you're an NFT trader, collector, or market analyst, this Telegram-native assistant brings you **on-demand market intelligence—powered by OpenSea and AI.**

&gt; ⚠️ **Important:** This workflow **requires three sub-workflows** to function properly. These must be downloaded and published in your n8n instance.

## **How It Works**  
1. A **Telegram bot** receives a message (e.g., “Top sales for Azuki”).  
2. The AI router in this workflow determines which agent should process the request:  
   - **Marketplace Agent** → Listings, offers, and orders  
   - **Analytics Agent** → Sales volume, price trends, wallet behavior  
   - **NFT Agent** → Metadata, traits, ownership info  
3. The selected agent queries the **OpenSea API** using your API key.  
4. The response is processed using **GPT-4o-mini**, formatted, and sent back via Telegram.

## **What You Can Do with This Agent**  
🔹 **Discover undervalued NFTs** based on trait rarity and price  
🔹 **Track market trends** for any collection in real time  
🔹 **Compare collection performance** by volume, sales, and listings  
🔹 **Analyze flipping trends and whale activity** across wallets  
🔹 **Retrieve NFT ownership and metadata** instantly  
🔹 **View trait-specific offers** for insight into rarity-driven demand
