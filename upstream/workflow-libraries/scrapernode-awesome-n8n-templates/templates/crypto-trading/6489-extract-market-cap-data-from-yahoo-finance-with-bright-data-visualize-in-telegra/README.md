# Financial Insight Automation: Market Cap to Telegram via Bright Data

## 📊 Description

An automated n8n workflow that scrapes financial data from Yahoo Finance using Bright Data, processes market cap information, generates visual charts, and sends comprehensive financial insights directly to Telegram for instant notifications.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

This workflow operates through a simple three-zone process:

### 1. Data Input & Trigger
User submits a keyword (e.g., "AI", "Crypto", "MSFT") through a form trigger that initiates the financial data collection process.

### 2. Data Scraping & Processing  
Bright Data API discovers and scrapes comprehensive financial data from Yahoo Finance, including market cap, stock prices, company profiles, and financial metrics.

### 3. Visualization & Delivery
The system generates interactive market cap charts, saves data to Google Sheets for record-keeping, and sends visual insights to Telegram as PNG images.
