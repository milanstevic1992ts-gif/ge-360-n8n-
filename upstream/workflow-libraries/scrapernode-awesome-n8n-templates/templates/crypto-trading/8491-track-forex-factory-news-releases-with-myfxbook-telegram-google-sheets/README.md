If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

## Get Forex Factory News Release to Telegram, Google Sheets. Record News Data and Live Price from MyFxBook for Affected Currency Pairs.
### This n8n template demonstrates how to capture Actual Data Releases as quickly as possible for trading decisions.

### Use cases:
1. Get notified if the actual data release is positive or negative for the relevant currency.
2. Use the Telegram chat message about the news release as a trigger to open a trading position in MetaTrader 4.
3. Record news data and live price to google sheets for analysis.

### Currency Pairs
EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF, USDCAD, XAUUSD

### How it works
* A news release event acts as the trigger.
* Only news with a numerical Forecast value will be processed. Events that cannot be measured numerically (e.g., speeches) are ignored.
* Extract news details: currency, impact level (high/medium), release date, and news link.
* Wait 10 seconds to ensure the Actual value is available on the news page.
* Scrape the Actual value from the news link using Airtop.
* If the Actual value is not available, wait another 5 seconds and retry scraping.
* Extract both Actual and Forecast values from the scraped content.
* Remove non-numeric characters (%, K, M, B, T) and convert values to numbers.
* Determine the effect:
If the Actual value is lower than the Forecast value (and lower is better), send it to the True branch.
Otherwise, send it to the False branch.
* Record news data and live price from MyFxBook to Google Sheets.
