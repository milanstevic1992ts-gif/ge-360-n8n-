## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

**Time to magic:** 20 minutes

**You'll need:**
* OpenAI API Key (for GPT-4.1)
* Explorium MCP API Key
* Monday.com API Token
* Gmail OAuth credentials
* Monday.com webhook setup

**Step-by-step:**
1. Import this template into your n8n instance
2. Hook up Monday.com webhook via "Respond to Webhook" node
3. Deactivate that "Respond to Webhook" node (important!)
4. Plug in your API credentials
5. Customize agent prompts with YOUR company's secret sauce
6. Match your Monday.com columns to the workflow
7. Test drive with a dummy lead
8. Hit activate and watch the magic! ✨

## 📋 Requirements

* Monday.com board with these columns: Company Name, Contact Name, Email, Comments
* Explorium MCP access (for that company intelligence gold)
* OpenAI API (GPT-4.1 model ready)
* Gmail account (where drafts go to shine)

## 🎨 Make it yours

* Tweak email tone - formal, casual, or somewhere in between
* Adjust research depth in Company Researcher
* Add your unique value props to agent prompts
* Connect more data sources for extra enrichment
* Hook up other CRMs (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive)
* Add Slack alerts for hot leads 🔥

## 💪 Why this rocks

**Real talk:** Manual lead research is SO 2023. While your competitors are still googling companies, you're already in their inbox with an email that mentions their latest funding round, understands their tech stack, and offers solutions to problems they didn't even know you could solve.

This isn't just another "Hi {{first_name}}" template. It's AI that actually gets context, writes like a human, and makes your prospects think "How did they know exactly what we need?"

**Results you can expect:**
* Faster lead response time
* Higher email open rates
* Actually useful CRM data (not just "interested in our product")
* Your sales team thanking you (seriously)

**Pro tip:** The more context you feed the AI agents about your business, the scarier-good the personalization gets. Don't hold back on those System Message customizations!
