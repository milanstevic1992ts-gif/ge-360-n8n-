## Step-by-Step Node Guide  

### 1. Gmail Trigger  
Polls Gmail every hour for new emails.  
Filters out internal addresses (e.g., `@syncbricks.com`).  
Avoids replying to already-responded emails (`Re:` subject filter).

### 2. LangChain Text Classifier  
Uses AI to categorize the content of the email based on pre-defined categories:  
- **Guest Post**  
- **Youtube**  
- **Udemy Courses**

### 3. Google Gemini (PaLM) Chat Model *(Optional)*  
Provides additional AI support to enhance classification accuracy.  
Can be used to summarize or enrich the context if needed.

### 4. Email Send Nodes  
Each response category has a separate SMTP node with a custom HTML email:
- **Guest Post Inquiry**  
- **YouTube Video Inquiry**  
- **Udemy Course Inquiry**

### 5. Gmail: Mark as Read  
Marks the email so it isn’t processed again.

### 6. Gmail: Apply Label  
Adds a label (e.g., `Handled by Bot`) for organization.

### 7. Brevo: Create/Update Contact  
Saves the sender to your CRM for future communication or marketing.
