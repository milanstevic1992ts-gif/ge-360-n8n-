## Description

This workflow is a complete, production-ready solution for recovering abandoned carts in Shopify stores using a multi-channel, multi-touch approach. It automates personalized follow-ups via Email, SMS, and WhatsApp, tracks every customer interaction for multi-touch attribution, and enables advanced retargeting and analytics.

**Key features:**
- Multi-step, timed recovery sequence (Email → SMS → Email → WhatsApp)
- Customer segmentation (new, returning, VIP) and A/B testing
- Dynamic discounting and personalized messaging
- Touchpoint logging to Google Sheets for attribution analysis
- Facebook Custom Audience retargeting for unrecovered carts
- Slack notifications for high-value cart recoveries

---

## What does this workflow do?

1. **Listens for abandoned cart events** from Shopify (or any e-commerce platform) via webhook.
2. **Normalizes and enriches cart data** by fetching full cart details and customer purchase history.
3. **Predicts the likely reason for abandonment** (e.g., price sensitivity, checkout complexity, technical issues) using rule-based logic.
4. **Segments the customer** (new, returning, VIP), assigns an A/B test group, and generates a personalized discount and checkout URL.
5. **Runs a timed, multi-channel recovery sequence:**
   - **1 hour after abandonment:** Checks if the order is completed. If not, sends a personalized Email #1 and logs the touchpoint.
   - **4 hours after abandonment:** Checks again. If not recovered, sends an SMS with a discount code and logs the touchpoint.
   - **24 hours after abandonment:** Checks again. If not recovered, sends Email #2 (with social proof/urgency) and logs the touchpoint.
   - **48 hours after abandonment:** Final check. If not recovered, sends a WhatsApp reminder and logs the touchpoint.
6. **If the cart is still not recovered:** Hashes customer identifiers and adds them to a Facebook Custom Audience for retargeting.
7. **Logs every touchpoint** (email, SMS, WhatsApp) to a Google Sheet for multi-touch attribution analysis.
8. **Sends a Slack notification** if a high-value cart is recovered.

## Why is this workflow useful?

- **Boosts recovery rates:** By using multiple channels and personalized timing, you maximize the chance of recovering lost sales.
- **Improves attribution:** Every customer interaction is logged, so you can analyze which channels and messages drive conversions.
- **Enables advanced retargeting:** Unrecovered carts are automatically added to a Facebook Custom Audience for paid retargeting.
- **Saves time:** Fully automated, with easy configuration for your store, messaging, and analytics.
- **Scalable and extensible:** Easily adapt the sequence, add more channels, or integrate with other tools.
