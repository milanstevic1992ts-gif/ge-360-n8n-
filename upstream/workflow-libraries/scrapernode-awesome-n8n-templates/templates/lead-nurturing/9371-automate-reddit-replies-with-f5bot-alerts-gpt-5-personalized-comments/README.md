# 🤖 Reddit Auto-Comment Assistant (AI-Driven Marketing Workflow)

Automate how you reply to Reddit posts using **AI-generated, first-person comments** that sound human, follow subreddit rules, and (optionally) promote your own links or products.

---

## 🧩 Overview

This workflow monitors Reddit mentions (via **F5Bot Gmail alerts**) and automatically:
1. Fetches the relevant Reddit post.  
2. Checks the subreddit’s rules for self-promotion.  
3. Generates a comment using GPT-5 style prompting (human-like tone, &lt;255 chars).  
4. Optionally promotes your chosen product from Google Sheets.  
5. Posts the comment automatically

It’s ideal for creators, marketers, or founders who want to grow awareness **organically and authentically** on Reddit — without sounding like a bot.
