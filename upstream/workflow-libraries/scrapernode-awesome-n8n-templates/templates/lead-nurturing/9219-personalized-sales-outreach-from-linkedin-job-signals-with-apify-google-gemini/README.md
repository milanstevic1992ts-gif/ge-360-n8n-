# 💬 Personalized sales outreach from LinkedIn job signals with Apify & Google Gemini

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

![Overview.PNG](fileId:2762)

## This n8n template from [Intuz](https://www.intuz.com/) provides a complete and automated solution for identifying high-intent leads from LinkedIn job postings and automatically generating personalized outreach emails.

## Disclaimer
Community nodes are used in this workflow.

## Who’s this workflow for?
- B2B Sales Teams & SDRs
- Recruitment Agencies & Tech Recruiters
- Startup Founders
- Growth Marketing Teams

## How it works
**1. Scrape Hiring Signals:** The workflow starts by using an Apify scraper to find companies actively hiring for specific roles on LinkedIn (e.g., “ML Engineer”).

**2. Filter & Qualify Companies:** It automatically filters the results based on your criteria (e.g., company size, industry) to create a high-quality list of target accounts.

**3. Find Decision-Makers:** For each qualified company, it uses Apollo.io to find key decision-makers (VPs, Directors, etc.) and enrich their profiles with verified email addresses using user’s Apollo API.

**4. Build a Lead List:** All the enriched lead data—contact name, title, email, company info—is systematically added to a Google Sheet.

**5. Generate AI-Powered Emails:** The workflow then feeds each lead’s data to a Google Gemini AI model, which drafts a unique, personalized cold email that references the specific job the company is hiring for.

**6. Complete the Outreach List:** Finally, the AI-generated subject line and email body are saved back into the Google Sheet, leaving you with a fully prepared, hyper-targeted outreach campaign.

## Setup Instructions
**1. Apify Configuration:** 
- Connect your Apify account in the Run the LinkedIn Job Scraper node.

**2. Data Enrichment:**

**4. Google Sheets Setup:**
