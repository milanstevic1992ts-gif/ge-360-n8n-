## Troubleshooting

Video stuck in “processing”?
→ Increase the Wait node duration (30–60 sec).

Voice note too robotic?
→ Switch to a premium ElevenLabs voice.

Research not specific enough?
→ Strengthen the system prompt with more constraints.

Emails not arriving?
→ Ensure Gmail OAuth has send permission configured.

API authentication errors?
→ Check credentials in each node (OpenAI, Perplexity, HeyGen, etc.).
