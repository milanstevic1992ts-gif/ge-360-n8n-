When a visitor submits a form on your website, this AI agent dynamically:

Creates a video script tailored to the lead's input using an AI prompt agent
Generates a video using the Heygen API with a branded avatar
Crafts a contextual follow-up email embedding the video
Sends it to the lead’s inbox with a call-to-action

This is ideal for:

Marketing agencies looking to impress new prospects
Sales teams aiming to boost inbound conversions
Founders and freelancers building trust through instant video touchpoints
