---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Connect Accounts

Authenticate **Google Sheets** and **Gmail** nodes via OAuth2 in your n8n credentials settings.

### 2. Prepare Your Google Sheet

Your Google Sheet must contain the following columns:

```

Email
Name (or WF Full Name (metadata))
Is Email Sent

````

#### Example:

| Email               | Name          | Is Email Sent |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------|
| test@example.com   | John Doe      |                |
| jane@company.com   | Jane Smith    | yes            |

Only rows where `"Is Email Sent"` is **not** marked as `"yes"` will be processed.

### 3. Customize the Email Template

Open the **“Send Personalized Email”** node and update the `message` field. You can use variables like:

```handlebars
{{ $json.Name }}
{{ $json['WF Full Name (metadata)'] }}
````

#### Example Message:

```text
Hello {{ $json.Name || $json['WF Full Name (metadata)'] }},

### 4. Schedule the Workflow

Edit the **Schedule Trigger** node to your preferred time (currently set to 2 PM daily):


---

## Customization Tips

* Replace the email copy with your branding or offer.
* Add more fields (like company or industry) and update the message for deeper personalization.
* Modify the batch size in the **Split In Batches** node for rate control.

---

## Notes & Limitations

* **Gmail Quotas:** Gmail has sending limits (e.g., 500 emails/day for free accounts).
* **OAuth2 Scope Approval:** Ensure the necessary scopes (e.g., Gmail send and Sheets read/write) are granted.
* **Rate Limiting:** If working with large lists, consider time delays or throttle controls.
