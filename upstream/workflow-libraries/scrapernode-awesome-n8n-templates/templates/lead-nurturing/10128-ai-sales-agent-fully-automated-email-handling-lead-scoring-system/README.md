> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## 🧩 What This Workflow Does

### 🔹 1. Smart AI Email Analysis  
Every incoming email is parsed and sent to GPT-4o for structured classification:
- Detects **unsubscribe requests**, **automated replies**, or **manual responses**  
- Extracts **intent, sentiment, urgency, and key points**  
- Determines the **next best action** — follow-up, escalate, or close  

### 🔹 2. Personalized AI Replies  
When appropriate, the workflow automatically drafts replies that:
- Match the sender’s tone and intent  
- Address objections using *feel-felt-found* logic  
- Suggest the most relevant product or resource  
- Sign off naturally (e.g. “Sofia from Tech Powered Growth”)  

### 🔹 3. Lead Scoring & CRM Sync (NocoDB)  
Leads are continuously enriched and scored based on activity:
- +5 points for interested replies, +2 for clicks, –10 for unsubscribes  
- Status automatically transitions between *cold → warm → hot*  
- Daily maintenance updates decay inactive leads and schedule re-engagement  

### 🔹 4. Engagement Tracking & Insights  
The workflow tracks **opens, clicks, bounces, spam, and unsubscribes** from Brevo (Sendinblue), updating CRM records instantly.  
Each day, it generates a **performance report** with lead distribution, score changes, and actionable recommendations.
