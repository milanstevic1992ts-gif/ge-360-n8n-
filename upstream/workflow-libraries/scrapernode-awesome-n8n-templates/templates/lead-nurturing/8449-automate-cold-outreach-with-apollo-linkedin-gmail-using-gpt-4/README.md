> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

# Cold Outreach Automation by Rysysth Technologies  

This n8n workflow automates the complete cold outreach process by combining Apollo.io lead generation, LinkedIn networking, and personalized email outreach into one streamlined system.  

---

## How It Works  

### Prospect Definition (Form Input)  
User enters job titles, company size, keywords, and locations.  

### Apollo Search URL Generation  
OpenAI converts form inputs into a precise Apollo.io search URL.  

### Lead Scraping (Apify)  
Apollo.io scraper collects contact details, emails, LinkedIn profiles, and company data (limited to 10 leads per run).  

### LinkedIn & Company Data Enrichment (Unipile)  
Extracts LinkedIn profile and company details for each lead.  

### CRM Sync (HubSpot)  
Automatically creates or updates lead records in HubSpot CRM.  

### Personalized Outreach (AI-Powered)  
OpenAI generates:  
- Custom LinkedIn connection request (under 300 characters)  
- Email subject and body (personalized with a soft CTA)  

### LinkedIn Connect  
If not already connected, workflow sends LinkedIn invites via Unipile.  

### Email Validation (ZeroBounce)  
Ensures emails are valid or catch-all before outreach.  

### Email Outreach (Gmail API)  
If verified, sends the AI-personalized outreach email directly from Gmail.
