## Description

# **🏖️ AI-Based Tour Itineraries via Email Using OpenAI & Pinecone Vector Search**

## **Overview**
This workflow automates the process of handling new tour package requests received via email, analyzes the request, and provides personalized tour package recommendations using AI and a vector database. It’s designed to streamline customer interactions and deliver quick, relevant responses.

## **Precondition** 
1. Create a Embedded Tour Package Database (refer to the link below):
[Pinecone Database setup](https://creators.n8n.io/workflows/5085)
2. Register and create API Keys for OpenAI, Pinecone Database.
3. Copy Mail Credentials to access Email Inbox from n8n node

This workflow automates the process of extracting tour information from PDF files stored in a Google Drive folder, processes and vectorizes the extracted data, and stores it in a Pinecone vector database for efficient querying. This is especially useful for building AI-powered search or recommendation systems for travel packages.



## **🛠️ Tools & Nodes Used**
**Email Trigger (IMAP):** Monitors the inbox for new tour package requests.
**Text Classifier:** Categorizes incoming emails (e.g., New Request, Follow-up, Other).
**Code Node:** Extracts and structures relevant data from the email (subject, sender, content, etc.).
**Tour Recommendation AI Agent:** An AI agent that interprets the request and formulates a prompt for package recommendations.
**OpenAI & OpenRouter Chat Models:** Used for natural language understanding and generating responses.
**Simple Memory:** Maintains context for ongoing conversations.
**Pinecone Vector Store:** Stores and retrieves tour packages using semantic search.
**Embeddings (OpenAI):** Converts text data into vector embeddings for similarity search.
**Answer Questions with a Vector Store:** Retrieves the most relevant packages from Pinecone.
**Send Email:** Sends the AI-generated recommendations back to the customer.

### **🔄 Process & Flow**
**Email Reception:** The workflow starts with the Email Trigger (IMAP) node, which listens for new emails in the inbox.
**Classification:** The Text Classifier node determines if the email is a new tour package request.
**Data Extraction:** The Code node parses the email, extracting key details like sender, subject, and content.
**AI Agent Processing:** The Tour Recommendation AI Agent receives the structured request and crafts a prompt for package recommendations.
**Vector Search:** The agent queries the Pinecone Vector Store, which holds previously created tour packages, using OpenAI embeddings for semantic matching.

**Recommendation Generation:** The AI agent selects the top 3 most relevant packages and generates a friendly, personalized response.
**Response Delivery:** The Send Email node sends the recommendations back to the customer.

**🚀 Recommendations & Improvements for Next Version**
**Error Handling:** Add error handling nodes to manage failed email parsing or AI response issues.
**Logging & Analytics:** Integrate logging to track requests, recommendations, and customer responses for continuous improvement.
**Personalization:** Enhance the AI agent to consider customer history or preferences for even more tailored recommendations.
**Multi-language Support:** Add language detection and translation for international customers.
**Feedback Loop:** Include a mechanism for customers to rate recommendations, feeding this data back into the system for improved future suggestions.
**Attachment Handling:** Enable the workflow to process attachments (e.g., customer itineraries or preferences).
**Scalability:** Consider batching or queueing requests if email volume increases.

### **💡 Conclusion**
This workflow demonstrates how n8n, combined with AI and vector databases, can automate and personalize customer service in the travel industry. With a few enhancements, it can become even more robust and customer-centric!
