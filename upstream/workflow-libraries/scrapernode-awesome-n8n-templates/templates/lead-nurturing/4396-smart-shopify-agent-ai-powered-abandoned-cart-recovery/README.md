## Description

# 🤖 AI Cart Recovery Agent: Smart Abandoned Checkout Assistant

Transform abandoned carts into recovered sales with intelligent automation. This sophisticated n8n workflow monitors checkout abandonment, implements smart waiting periods, and sends AI-generated personalized recovery emails only when needed - maximizing conversions while respecting customer experience.

## 🔄 How It Works

This intelligent 7-step recovery system recovers lost sales automatically:

**Step 1: Initial Abandonment Detection**
The workflow fetches current abandoned checkout data from your e-commerce platform (Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.), identifying customers who added items but didn't complete their purchase.

**Step 2: Strategic Grace Period**
Instead of immediately sending recovery emails, the system waits 1 hour (customizable), giving customers natural time to complete their purchase without pressure or interruption.

**Step 3: Smart Re-verification**
After the waiting period, the workflow rechecks the abandonment status by fetching updated checkout data, ensuring accuracy before taking action.

**Step 4: Intelligent Decision Logic**
Advanced conditional logic compares initial and updated abandonment lists, determining if customers are still abandoned or have completed their purchase during the grace period.

**Step 5: AI-Powered Email Generation**
For customers still showing abandonment, GPT generates personalized recovery emails featuring:
- Customer's actual name for personal connection
- Specific products left in their cart
- Friendly, non-pushy messaging tone
- Optional discount incentives
- Compelling call-to-action to complete purchase

**Step 6: Automated Email Delivery**
Personalized recovery emails are sent directly to abandoned customers via Gmail or your preferred email service, maintaining professional branding and deliverability.

**Step 7: Comprehensive Activity Logging**
All recovery attempts are logged in Google Sheets for tracking, including customer details, email content, and campaign performance analytics.
