> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

# Multi Product AI Email Automation with SMTP Rotation & No-Code Workflow(OpenAI GPT-4o or o3-mini)

## 🚀 Why This Workflow Matters
- **True Multi-Offer Campaigns**  
  Promote any mix of products, services or solutions in one run; no separate workflows needed.
- **SMTP Load Balancing**  
  A Switch node rotates sends across five Gmail/SMTP accounts to spread volume, avoid rate limits and boost deliverability.
- **Model Flexibility**  
  Supports GPT-4o, GPT-3 or OpenAI o3-mini for query generation and email personalization.
- **Personalized Outreach**  
  The AI reads each prospect’s website, then crafts concise (&lt;200 words) HTML emails tailored to their needs, embedding the right offer and link.
- **SEO & Conversion Focus**  
  Every message uses SEO-smart phrasing, clear hooks and a direct call to action to your specific page.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Define All Offers**  
   In the `pinData` node, list each product/service with its name, description and URL.  
2. **Smart Query Generation**  
   The AI builds 100 targeted Google Maps searches per offer to uncover ideal leads.  
3. **Data Extraction**  
   Scrape website content, dedupe URLs and emails, then compile verified email lists.  
4. **Dynamic Email Creation**  
   For each lead, the workflow picks an offer, analyzes their site and generates a personalized HTML email with the correct link.  
5. **SMTP Rotation & Throttling**  
   A Switch node randomly assigns one of five Gmail/SMTP accounts, then applies a random delay to mimic human sending patterns and manage quotas.

## 💡 Key Benefits
- **Scale Effortlessly**: Run thousands of personalized emails daily without manual effort.  
- **Protect Sender Reputation**: Distribute sends across multiple accounts and built-in delays.  
- **Drive Targeted Traffic**: SEO-optimized outreach that resonates with prospects and points them to the right solution.

## 📈 Ideal Use Cases
