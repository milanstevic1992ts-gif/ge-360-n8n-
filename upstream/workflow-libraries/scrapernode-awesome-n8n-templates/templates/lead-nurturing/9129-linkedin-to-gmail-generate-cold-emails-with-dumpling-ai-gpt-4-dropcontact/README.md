# 💬 LinkedIn to Gmail: generate cold emails with Dumpling AI, GPT-4 & Dropcontact

> ⚡ **210 views** · 💬 [Lead Nurturing & AI Sales Agents](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

## Who’s it for

## What it does

Once a LinkedIn company profile URL is submitted via a web form, the workflow:
1. Scrapes detailed company data using **Dumpling AI**
2. Enriches the contact (email, name, country) using **Dropcontact**
3. Sends company data and contact info to **GPT-4**, which generates:
   - A personalized subject line (max 8 words)
   - A short HTML cold email (4–6 sentences)
4. Sends the cold email via **Gmail**
5. Logs the lead details to **Airtable** for tracking

All AI-generated content follows strict formatting and tone guidelines, ensuring it's professional, human, and clean.

## How it works

1. **Form Trigger**: Collects the LinkedIn URL  
2. **Dumpling AI**: Extracts company name, description, size, location, website, etc.  
3. **Dropcontact**: Finds the contact's email and name based on enriched company details  
4. **GPT-4**: Writes a structured cold email and subject line in JSON format  
5. **Gmail**: Sends the personalized email to a fixed recipient  
6. **Airtable**: Logs the lead into a specified base/table for follow-up

## Requirements

- ✅ **Dumpling AI API key** (stored in HTTP header credentials)  
- ✅ **Dropcontact API key**  
- ✅ **OpenAI GPT-4 credentials**  
- ✅ **Gmail account** (OAuth2)  
- ✅ **Airtable** base & table set up with at least these fields:
  - `Name`
  - `LinkedIn Company URL`
  - `People`
  - `website`

## How to customize

- Modify the GPT prompt to reflect your brand tone or service offering  
- Replace Gmail with Slack, Outlook, or another communication tool  
- Add a “review and approve” step before sending emails  
- Add logic to avoid duplicates (e.g., check Airtable first)
