## Description

## How it works

This workflow is your personal **CEO Brain**. Every Saturday night, it automatically collects the past week’s activity across:

- 📩 Gmail: filters out spam, promos, receipts, etc.  
- 📅 Google Calendar: grabs past week and upcoming month  
- 🗒️ Notion Weekly Plan: pulls and analyzes a photo of your weekly plan (e.g., taken from a paper planner/notebook) using GPT-4o  
- 🎯 Notion OKRs: fetches quarterly OKRs and formats them for summary

It sends all the data to GPT-4.1, which generates a smart weekly report — including progress check, misalignments, overdue follow-ups, and next steps — then emails it to you as a **Weekly OKR Report**.

## Set up steps

- 🧠 Add your Gmail, Google Calendar, Notion, and OpenAI credentials  
- 📅 The Notion Weekly Plan should have a **date property** and an **image field** that holds a photo of your planner/notebook page  
- 🎯 The Notion OKR database should include **objective**, **key result**, and **status** fields  
- 🔁 Schedule is preset to **every Saturday at 20:30 HK time** (cron `0 30 20 * * 6`). Also set the **workflow timezone in n8n** and, if self-hosting, the **server/container TZ** (e.g., `TZ=Asia/Hong_Kong`) to ensure correct triggering  
- 💬 You can modify the AI prompts inside the LLM nodes for more customized outputs
