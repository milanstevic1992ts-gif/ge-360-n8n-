> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Job boards are notoriously hard to scrape — CAPTCHAs, rate limits, constantly changing layouts. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) has maintained scrapers for [Indeed jobs](https://scrapernode.com/indeed/scrapers/jobs), [Glassdoor reviews](https://scrapernode.com/glassdoor/scrapers/reviews), and [Glassdoor jobs](https://scrapernode.com/glassdoor/scrapers/jobs) that handle all of that for you.

Automatically track new freelance job postings from any platform using **Apify Actors**, process the results, and get **real-time WhatsApp alerts** for new opportunities.  
This workflow saves jobs to Google Sheets for record-keeping and sends instant notifications so you never miss a client lead.

## Who’s it for
Freelancers, agencies, and business developers who want to monitor platforms like **Upwork, Fiverr, or Freelancer** for new jobs — without checking manually.

## How it works
1. The workflow starts when a **chat message** or trigger event is received.  
2. It runs an **Apify Actor** to scrape job listings from your target platform.  
3. The **dataset results** are fetched via Apify’s API.  
4. A **JavaScript Code node** processes and filters the results for relevant jobs.  
5. The data is saved to **Google Sheets** for tracking and reporting.  
6. A formatted job summary is created and sent as a **WhatsApp message** directly to your phone.
