## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy the workflow in **Make.com** (compatible with n8n):

### 1. **Import the Workflow**
- In Make.com or n8n, go to **Scenarios &gt; Import from File**
- Upload the provided JSON template

### 2. **Set Up Scheduling**
- Locate the **Schedule Trigger** node
- Confirm times are set to:
  - `10:00 AM`
  - `3:00 PM`
- Adjust **timezone** in Make/n8n settings to match your audience

### 3. **Configure GIF Library**
- Open the **"Pick Random GIF"** node
- Replace placeholder URLs with your own:
  - Hosted on Giphy, Imgur, or a public CDN
  - Must end in `.gif` and allow hotlinking
- Example:
  ```text
  https://media.giphy.com/media/abc123/giphy.gif
  ```

### 4. **Connect Messaging Platform**
Choose **Slack** or **Discord**:

#### For Slack:
- Go to **Send to Slack** node
- Replace `{{SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL}}` with your incoming webhook
- Ensure the channel allows bot messages

#### For Discord:
- Go to **Send to Discord** node
- Replace `{{DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL}}` with your server webhook
- Enable embed permissions

&gt; 🔗 Webhook Guide:
&gt; - [Slack Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)
&gt; - [Discord Webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)

### 5. **Enable Reaction Polling (Slack)**
- In **Get Slack Reactions**, add:
  - `{{SLACK_BOT_TOKEN}}` with scopes:
    - `reactions:read`
    - `channels:history`
  - `{{SLACK_CHANNEL_ID}}` (e.g., `C012AB3CD`)
- The workflow uses the message timestamp to fetch reactions after 24 hours

&gt; ⚠️ Discord note: Native reaction polling requires a **Discord bot**. This version supports Slack; Discord support can be extended using the Discord API.

### 6. **Set Up Airtable Logging**
- In **Log in Airtable** node:
  - Enter your **Airtable Base ID**
  - Ensure table `Hydration Reactions` exists (see structure below)
  - Map fields correctly (Date, Username, Reaction Count, etc.)
- Connect your **Airtable API credential**

## 🗃️ Airtable Base Structure

This workflow logs every ✅ reaction into Airtable for long-term tracking.

### Base: `Community Wellness Tracker`

#### Table: `Hydration Reactions`

| Field | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `Date` | Date | Date of the reminder (auto-filled) |
| `Time Slot` | Single Select | `10:00 AM` or `3:00 PM` |
| `User ID` | Text | Slack/Discord user ID |
| `Username` | Text | Display name (e.g., `@alex`) |
| `Platform` | Single Select | `Slack` or `Discord` |
| `Reaction Count` | Number | Always `1` per reaction |
| `Message Timestamp` | Text | Message ID for reference |
| `Processed` | Checkbox | Marked `false` initially |

&gt; 🏆 Use a **Grouped View** in Airtable to create a monthly leaderboard:
&gt; - Group by `Username`
&gt; - Rollup: `SUM(Reaction Count)`

## 🔄 Workflow Explanation

The automation runs a **daily cycle** with feedback tracking:

1. **Trigger**: Fires at 10 AM and 3 PM via **Schedule node**
2. **GIF Selection**: Randomly picks a calming hydration GIF
3. **Message Delivery**: Sends formatted message to Slack or Discord
4. **Wait**: Pauses for 24 hours to allow reactions
5. **Reaction Check**: Uses Slack API to fetch ✅ reactions
6. **Filter**: Only proceeds if at least one ✅ is found
7. **Log**: Creates a record in Airtable for each reacting user

🔁 This creates a **self-sustaining wellness loop**—encouraging care and capturing engagement.
