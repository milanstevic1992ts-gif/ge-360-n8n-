## Description

This n8n workflow automatically finds apartments for rent in Germany, filters them by your city, rent budget, and number of rooms, and applies to them via email. Each application includes:
- A personalized German cover letter
- Schufa report (fetched dynamically from Google Drive)
- Recent salary slips (also fetched from Google Drive)

The workflow runs daily at a scheduled time, emails landlords or agencies automatically, and logs every application into a Google Sheet for tracking.

## How It Works
1. **Scheduled Trigger** – Runs every day at 9 AM (adjustable).
2. **Fetch Listings** – Uses immobilienscout24 API (or similar) to pull rental listings for your selected city.
3. **Filter Listings** – Keeps only listings matching your CITY, MAX_RENT, and ROOMS settings.
4. **Fetch Documents** – Retrieves your Schufa report and salary slips from Google Drive (no need for local hosting).
5. **Generate Cover Letter** – Creates a personalized German-language letter per apartment.
6. **Send Email Application** – Sends the email to the landlord or agent with cover letter + documents attached.
7. **Log Applications** – Saves each application (title, address, rent, date) in a Google Sheet.


## How to Use
1. Import the workflow JSON into n8n.
2. Set environment variables in n8n (for security):
	-  **immobilienscout24_TOKEN:** Your immobilienscout24 API token
	-  **immobilienscout24_LISTING_ACTOR:** Actor ID for your preferred rental listing scraper (or custom)
	-  **MY_EMAIL:**  Your sender email address (SMTP configured in n8n)
	-  **SCHUFA_FILE_ID:**  Google Drive File ID for your Schufa PDF
	-  **SALARY_FILE_ID:** Google Drive File ID for your Salary Slips PDF
	-  **APPLICATION_SHEET_ID:** Google Sheet ID to log applications
3. Authenticate Google Drive and Google Sheets (OAuth2 in n8n).
4. Customize search filters in the Set Config node:
	- **CITY** (e.g., Berlin)
	- **MAX_RENT** (e.g., 1200)
	- **ROOMS** (e.g., 2)
5. Activate the workflow – It will run daily at the configured time and send applications automatically.
6. Check your Google Sheet – Every application will be logged for tracking.
