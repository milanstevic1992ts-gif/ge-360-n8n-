> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Job boards are notoriously hard to scrape — CAPTCHAs, rate limits, constantly changing layouts. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) has maintained scrapers for [Indeed jobs](https://scrapernode.com/indeed/scrapers/jobs), [Glassdoor reviews](https://scrapernode.com/glassdoor/scrapers/reviews), and [Glassdoor jobs](https://scrapernode.com/glassdoor/scrapers/jobs) that handle all of that for you.

## Description

##  What this workflow does

This workflow automates the discovery, evaluation, and notification of job opportunities based on a candidate’s professional profile.

It fetches remote job listings, compares each role against a structured candidate profile stored in Google Sheets, and uses AI to evaluate real alignment in terms of skills, seniority, salary, industry, and role complexity.

Only the most relevant opportunities are kept, stored in Google Sheets, and delivered via email as a Top 5 shortlist.
