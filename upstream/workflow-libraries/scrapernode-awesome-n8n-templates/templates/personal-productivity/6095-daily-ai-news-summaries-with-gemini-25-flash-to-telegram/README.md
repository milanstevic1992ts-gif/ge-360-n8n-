  * **📰 Monitors an RSS Feed:** Automatically triggers whenever a new article is published on the specified AI news feed (`artificialintelligence-news.com`).
  * **🧠 Scrapes Article Content:** Uses [Jina AI](https://jina.ai/) to read and extract the full, clean text from the article link.

  * **📨 Delivers to Telegram:** Sends the final, perfectly formatted markdown report as a message to your chosen Telegram chat.

### 🛠️ What you'll need to get started
