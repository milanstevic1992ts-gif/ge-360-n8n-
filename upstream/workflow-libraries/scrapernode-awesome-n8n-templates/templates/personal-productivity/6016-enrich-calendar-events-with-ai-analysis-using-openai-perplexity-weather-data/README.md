# 🤖 Smart Calendar Agent: Enrich Calendar Events with AI Analysis using OpenAI, Perplexity & Weather Data

## Problem
😤 Calendar management is a NIGHTMARE.

I waste hours manually checking weather, researching restaurants, remembering flight details, and missing important prep work for events—scattered, reactive, exhausting.

I wish calendars were actually SMART and would automatically prepare me for every event!

If only I could just add:
"Flight DL123 tomorrow at 9 AM from SFO to JFK"
and instantly get terminal info, check-in reminders, weather updates, and travel tips delivered right to my phone.

Introducing **Smart Calendar Agent**, an automated agentic workflow powered by n8n that turns your calendar into a proactive AI assistant.

## Prerequisites

Required accounts/API keys for Google Calendar, OpenAI, OpenWeatherMap, Perplexity, and Telegram.

## This would be helpful for:
🎯 **Busy Professionals**: Never miss important event prep again
🎯 **Frequent Travelers**: Get flight details, weather updates, and travel tips automatically  
🎯 **Event Planners**: Stay ahead of weather changes and venue details
🎯 **Anyone**: Transform reactive calendar checking into proactive event intelligence

## Step-by-step workflow:
Takes 10-15 minutes to setup.

1. **Schedule Trigger** runs daily at 8 AM to scan your calendar
2. **Smart Calendar Agent** analyzes each event and classifies type (flight, meeting, outdoor activity, etc.)
3. **Contextual Intelligence** automatically executes relevant actions:
   - **Flights**: Fetches terminal info, boarding gates, check-in procedures
   - **Weather-sensitive events**: Gets weather forecasts and clothing suggestions  
   - **Restaurant reservations**: Gathers reviews and insights via Perplexity
   - **Back-to-back meetings**: Detects scheduling conflicts and suggests fixes
   - **Travel bookings**: Provides packing suggestions based on destination weather
4. **Google Calendar integration** reads your events and context
5. **OpenWeatherMap** provides weather forecasts for location-based events
6. **Perplexity AI** researches venues, reviews, and travel requirements
7. **Telegram notifications** deliver perfectly timed, actionable insights to your phone

## Sample Query
**Input**: Calendar Event - "Flight DL123 tomorrow at 9 AM from SFO to JFK"

**Output**: Telegram notification - "✈️ Make sure to carry your REAL ID and boarding pass. The flight will depart from Terminal 2, Boarding Gate 1. Traffic to SFO: 45 mins from your location."

The system automatically sends contextual reminders 24 hours before flights, weather updates the night before outdoor events, and conflict alerts 30 minutes before back-to-back meetings.

Never be caught unprepared again—your calendar just got a brain! 🧠

## Customizations

The Smart Calendar Agent is modular — you can mix and match services to fit your tech stack, region, and preferences. Here’s how you can customize each part of the workflow:

### 🔄 Replace Perplexity AI with Your Preferred AI Search Tool
If you don’t have access to Perplexity’s API or prefer another tool, swap it out easily:

Claude AI (Anthropic)

Use Claude for deeper, context-aware responses.

Replace the Perplexity HTTP Request node with an Anthropic-compatible OpenAI node using claude-3-opus or similar via https://api.anthropic.com.

Gemini (Google)

Use Vertex AI or Gemini API to generate summaries or travel tips.

Custom Web Scraper + GPT-4

Scrape restaurant/event URLs and feed scraped data to GPT for summarization.

Example:
Instead of Perplexity suggesting restaurant reviews, use Claude to analyze Google Maps reviews and suggest the top 3 things to try.

### 📆 Replace Google Calendar with Another Calendar Provider
Use a different calendar tool by adjusting your data source:

Microsoft Outlook Calendar

Use n8n’s Microsoft Graph integration.

Requires Azure App registration and Calendars.Read scope.


Notion Calendar (via Notion API)

Pull event data from a Notion table that acts like a calendar.

CSV or Google Sheets Input

Parse a CSV or Sheet that stores event information and act on that.

Example:
Use Outlook Calendar to pull events for the day, fetch weather via OpenWeatherMap, and message you on Slack.

### 📲 Replace Telegram with Other Notification Platforms
You can notify yourself through your preferred messaging app:

✅ WhatsApp (via Twilio or Ultramsg)
Use n8n’s HTTP Request node to call Twilio API for WhatsApp.

Send templated messages including time, location, and action items.

✅ Slack
Use Slack’s Webhook URL or Slack Node in n8n.

Great for team-wide prep messages or workspace reminders.

✅ Discord
Use a Discord Webhook to post prep summaries into a private server or DM.

✅ Email
Use the Email node in n8n to send daily summaries to your inbox.

Example:
Instead of sending alerts on Telegram, send a beautifully formatted Slack message 30 minutes before a flight.

### 🌐 Enhance with Other External Data Sources
Go beyond weather and flights:

FlightAware API: For accurate flight status updates, delays, and gate changes

Google Maps API: Estimate travel time to event location + suggest departure time

Eventbrite or Ticketmaster API: Fetch event entry rules, artist lineup, or parking info

ChatGPT Plugins (via Browser automation or 3rd-party wrappers): Fetch contextual insights from anywhere online

Example:
If your event is an outdoor concert, fetch artist bios via Ticketmaster, weather updates from OpenWeather, and Uber travel estimates from Google Maps API.

### 🧠 Personalize the AI Prompts for Your Needs
Customize the way OpenAI responds:

Add your name, preferences, or tone of voice in the system prompt

Tell it your travel habits, favorite cuisines, or packing preferences

Prompt Example:
“I’m a vegan traveler with asthma — summarize how I should prepare for this flight from NYC to Delhi and what the AQI is expected to be.”.
