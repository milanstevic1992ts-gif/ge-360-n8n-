# AI-Powered Discord Task Manager with Priority Intelligence
Mission-Aligned Task Tracker: Discord + AI + Google Sheets

### Opening Summary
This n8n template demonstrates how to automate task management by syncing tasks from a Discord channel to Google Sheets, enriching them with AI-driven prioritization, and delivering a daily prioritized digest back to Discord. It streamlines task organization aligned with personal mission and productivity frameworks.

### Use cases are many:
* Try managing your team’s project tasks by automatically prioritizing them based on strategic goals!
* Try personal task tracking with AI-powered prioritization for optimized daily productivity!
* Try automating follow-ups and completed task archiving seamlessly between Discord and Google Sheets!

### Good to know
* Using OpenAI GPT-4.1 and GPT-5 mini models may incur API costs based on usage (check your OpenAI pricing plan).
* Google Sheets API has rate limits; large task volumes may require batch adjustments to avoid quota errors.
* Discord API OAuth2 authentication is needed with permissions to read messages, add reactions, and post messages.
* The workflow requires shared Google Sheets with specific sheets named `Tasks` and `completed tasks` (template link provided).
* Reaction emojis in Discord (✍️ for processed, ✅ for completed) are used to track task status within Discord.
* AI-driven prioritization follows mission alignment based on Eisenhower Matrix, energy levels, and impact scoring. 

### Uses concepts from: 
- Deep work by Cal Newport
- Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less – Greg McKeown (2014)
- Getting Results the Agile Way – J.D. Meier
- Hyperfocus – Chris Bailey (2018)
- Slow Productivity – Cal Newport (2024)
Newport’s newest book. Explicitly about doing fewer things, working at a natural pace, and obsessing over quality—basically Deep Work 2.0

### How it works
* `Schedule Trigger` fires hourly to initiate task syncing.
* `Set discord IDs here` node defines Discord server and channel IDs for input/output.
* `get data - tasks Channel` fetches all messages from the Discord input channel.
* `Loop Over Items1` and `if message is recorded already` prevent reprocessing tasks.
* `clean data` prepares message information to uniform structure.
* `ai task organizer` node sends each task text to OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini agent, which analyzes and assigns priority, impact, energy level, category, and other metadata aligned to the user's mission.
* Tasks are appended to Google Sheets `Tasks` sheet using `Append row in task sheet`.
* `react to confirm` adds a reaction on Discord to mark the message as processed.
* `Get tasks to do` retrieves all in-progress tasks from Google Sheets for daily prioritization.
* Aggregated task data is analyzed by the `AI Agent` with GPT-5 mini to select top 6 tasks (3 high-energy, 3 low-energy).
* The daily prioritized list is split into acceptable message sizes and sent back to a Discord output channel by `Send a message` node.
* The workflow checks for tasks with ✅ reactions in Discord (`get checked ones`), updates their status to "Completed" in Google Sheets (`Update row in sheet`).
* Completed tasks are moved to a separate `completed tasks` sheet (`move completed rows to completed sheet`) and deleted from active list (`delete completed rows`) in a loop until none remain.
* Wait nodes and limits are used to control API call pacing and batch sizes.

### How to use
* Set your Discord server and channel IDs for input (`tasks-to-do`) and output (`my-prio-tasks-today`) in the `Set discord IDs here` node.
* Connect your Google Sheets account and set the Spreadsheet ID in all relevant nodes (the sheet must have `Tasks` and `completed tasks` sheets with expected columns).
* Add your OpenAI API credentials for GPT-4.1 mini (task processing) and GPT-5 mini (daily digest).
* Ensure your Discord app has OAuth2 tokens with message read, react, and post permissions.
* Post tasks as messages in the configured Discord input channel.
* Run the workflow or activate it; it will sync, process, prioritize, and update tasks automatically on schedule.
* Customize the schedule trigger if you want more frequent or different syncing intervals.
### Requirements
* Discord account and bot/app with OAuth2 app credentials for message read, react, and post permissions.
* Google Sheets account for task data storage, with a spreadsheet structured as specified (Sheets: `Tasks`, `completed tasks`).
* OpenAI API account with access to GPT-4.1 mini and GPT-5 mini models for AI task analysis and summarization.
* Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials configured in n8n.
* Properly set Discord server and channel IDs in the workflow.

### Customising this workflow
* Try adding support for multiple Discord servers or channels to centralize tasks from different teams or projects.
* Extend AI prompts to include deadlines parsing or automated reminders.
* Customize the Google Sheets columns or the scoring logic to fit your unique productivity frameworks or KPIs.
* Incorporate notifications via email or Slack based on task priority or completion.
* Replace Google Sheets with other databases if scalable storage is required.
* Adjust the energy level and impact criteria in AI prompts to match your personal productivity rhythms.
