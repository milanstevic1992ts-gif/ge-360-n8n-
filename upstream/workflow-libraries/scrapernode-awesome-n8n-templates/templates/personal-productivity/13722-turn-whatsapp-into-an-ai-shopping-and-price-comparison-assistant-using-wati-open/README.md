## Description

Elevate your shopping experience with an AI-driven personal assistant that lives right in your WhatsApp. This template automates the entire lifecycle of a shopping list—from intelligent intake and live web price comparisons to proactive daily deal alerts—by combining WATI, OpenAI, Serper (Google Search), and Google Sheets.

## 🎯 What This Workflow Does

Turns WhatsApp into a high-powered price engine across three independent pipelines:

### 📥 Pipeline A: Intelligent Intake
When a user sends a list (e.g., `list: milk 2L, eggs 12`), OpenAI parses every item into structured categories, quantities, and units before saving them to the Google Sheets master list.

### 🔍 Pipeline B: Live Price Engine
When a user types `compare`, the bot triggers a real-time web search via Serper. OpenAI then analyzes the search results to pick the absolute best deal and alternative stores, sending back a formatted "Comparison Card" with links.

### 📬 Pipeline C: Proactive Deal Alerts
A scheduled trigger runs daily at 8 AM, scanning your saved items for price drops. If it finds a saving of ≥ 10%, it automatically pings the user with a personalized deal alert.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Semantic Parsing:** OpenAI understands natural language lists, so you don't have to follow strict formatting.
- **Live Search Integration:** Uses the Serper API to fetch actual live prices from major Indian retailers in seconds.
- **Automated UI:** Uses custom emojis and visual bar charts to group items by category (e.g., 🥦 Produce, 🥛 Dairy) for easy mobile viewing.
- **Duplicate Prevention:** The "Savings Tracker" logic de-duplicates items so you only ever see the latest, most relevant price for any product.
- **Maintenance Commands:** Simple keywords like `clear` allow users to reset their list and start fresh.

## 💼 Perfect For

- **Savvy Shoppers:** Finding the lowest prices on groceries and electronics without manual searching.
- **Budget-Conscious Households:** Tracking long-term price trends for recurring household purchases.
- **E-commerce Researchers:** Monitoring competitor pricing and deals automatically.
- **Teams:** Sharing a centralized shopping list that updates with live market data.
