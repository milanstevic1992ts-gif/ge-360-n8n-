**Who It’s For:**

- This workflow is designed for developers, founders, community managers, and automation enthusiasts who want to bring a personal AI assistant directly into their Telegram chat.

🧠 AI Processing: The text is passed to an AI Agent powered by GPT-4.1-mini to understand intent and craft a response.
💬 Reply: The bot sends a clean, structured, and polite answer back to the user on Telegram.
