## Step-by-step

📅 **Google Calendar Triggers** (Event Created/Updated): 
The workflow starts immediately upon creation or update of any calendar event, enabling real-time detection of new or changed travel plans.

✈ **Identify Trips**: 
Filters these calendar events to detect travel-related trips by matching keywords such as "trip," "flight," or "vacation" in titles or descriptions.

📍**Extract Locations**: 
Parses each trip event’s details to extract start and end dates and the trip destination from the summary/description/location fields.

🌐 **Build interrogation URL**: 
Constructs a Visual Crossing API request URL dynamically based on the extracted trip location and dates, including daily forecasts and alerts.
Fetches the detailed weather forecast and alert data for the trip location and duration right after detecting the event.
Formats the raw weather data into a readable summary 🌤️🌪🌀 including temperatures, precipitation probabilities, conditions, and eventual severe weather alerts.

📲 📧 **Send Forecast**: 
Sends the forecast summary with alerts via Telegram to keep the user informed instantly.

⌛**One day before the trip**: 
Pauses the workflow until exactly one day before the trip start date, ensuring a timely second fetch when more accurate or updated weather data is available and the updated forecast is sent.

## Optional
You can replace the Telegram node with email, WhatsApp, Slack, SMS notifications, or add multiple notification nodes to receive them across all desired channels.
