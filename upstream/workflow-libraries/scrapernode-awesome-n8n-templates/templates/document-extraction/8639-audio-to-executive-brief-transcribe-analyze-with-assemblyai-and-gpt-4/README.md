## Description

# 🎙️ Audio-to-Insights Workflow (Form Upload + Google Drive Link)

## Description
This workflow enables seamless **speech-to-text transcription, AI-powered summarization, sentiment analysis, and automated email delivery**.  
It supports two different input modes:

- **Form Upload (Local File)**
- **Form Submission (Google Drive Link)**

---

## How it Works
1. **Input**
   - Form 1: Upload an audio file (e.g., .mp3,.wav,.mp4)
   - Form 2: Submit a Google Drive link

2. **File Handling**
   - Local uploads go directly to AssemblyAI.
   - Drive links are parsed → File ID extracted → File fetched → Sent to AssemblyAI.

3. **Transcription**
   - AssemblyAI generates transcript text with punctuation and highlights.
   - Workflow loops with `Wait + If` until transcript status = `completed`.

4. **AI Analysis**
   - Transcript is passed to OpenAI.
   - Generates a structured output including:
     - Executive summary
     - Sentiment label & score
     - Key points
     - Action items
     - Notable quotes
     - Topics

5. **Email Delivery**
   - A formatted email is sent via Gmail with the summary and insights.
