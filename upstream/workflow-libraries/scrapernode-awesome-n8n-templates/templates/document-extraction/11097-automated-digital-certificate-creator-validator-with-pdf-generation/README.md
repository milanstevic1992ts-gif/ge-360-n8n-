### ✔ 1. Certificate Generation

When a **POST webhook** request arrives, the workflow:

* reads name, surname, course, and email
  
* generates a **unique Certification ID**
  
* saves everything in the Data Table
  

### ✔ 2. Data Storage

Every issued certificate is recorded in an **n8n Data Table** containing:

* Name
  
* Surname
  
* CertificationID
  

This creates a permanent, searchable certificate registry.

### ✔ 3. PDF Creation

Uses **PDF Generator API** to create a professional PDF certificate from an HTML template:

* fully customizable (layout, colors, branding)
  
* includes candidate data, course, ID, and date
  

### ✔ 4. Email Delivery

The workflow automatically sends the certificate to the recipient using Gmail OAuth2 with:

* a predefined subject
  
* the PDF attached
  
* a customizable message
  

### ✔ 5. Verification System

A public endpoint `/certificationscheck` allows:

* validation of Certification IDs
  
* returning the candidate’s name and surname if valid
  
* responding with `ok: true/false`
  

### ✔ 6. Included Mini Verification Website

A ready-to-use HTML file allows users to:

* enter a Certification ID
  
* verify its authenticity
  
* view name and surname if the certificate exists
  
* Fully customizable (CSS, texts, branding).

* `Find_Certification_By_ID1`
  

Make sure the Data Table has the fields:

| Field | Type |
| --- | --- |

## 🔧 How the Workflow Works

### 🧩 1. Webhook `/certifications`

Receives candidate data and triggers the workflow.

`POST https://YOUR-N8N-DOMAIN.com/webhook/certification Headers: name: John surname: Doe course: email: john.doe@example.com`

### 🧩 2. Unique ID Generation

A Code node creates a random alphanumeric ID.If it already exists, a new one is generated.

### 🧩 3. Data Table Insert

Stores the certificate data for future lookup.

### 🧩 4. PDF Generation

Builds a PDF from the (fully editable) HTML template.

### 🧩 5. Email Sending

Delivers the certificate to the candidate.

## 🔍 Certificate Verification (`/certificationscheck`)

### API Behavior

Send a `POST` request `https://YOUR-N8N-DOMAIN.com/webhook/certificationcheck with header` `id: CERTIFICATION-ID`.

**Valid ID:**

`{ "ok": "true", "name": "John", "surname": "Doe" }`

**Invalid ID:**

`{ "ok": "false" }`

This request can be made **manually** (from tools like Postman, cURL, or your backend), **or automatically through the HTML verification page** included in the GitHub repository (the `Cerification_Check.html` template) found in your project files
