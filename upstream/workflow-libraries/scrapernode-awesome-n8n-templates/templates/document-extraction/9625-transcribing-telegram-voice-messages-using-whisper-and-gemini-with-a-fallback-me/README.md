# 🎙️ n8n Workflow: Voice Message Transcription with Access Control

This n8n workflow enables automated transcription of voice messages in Telegram groups with built-in access control and intelligent fallback mechanisms. It's designed for teams that need to convert audio messages to text while maintaining security and handling various audio formats.

---

## 📌 Section 1: Trigger & Access Control

### ⚡ Receive Message (Telegram Trigger)
**Purpose:** Captures incoming messages from users in your Telegram group.

**How it works:** When a user sends a message (voice, audio, or text), the workflow is triggered and the sender's information is captured.

**Benefit:** Serves as the entry point for the entire transcription pipeline.

### 🔐 Sender Verification
**Purpose:** Validates whether the sender has permission to use the transcription service.

**Logic:**
Check sender against authorized users list
If authorized → Proceed to next step
If not authorized → Send "Access denied" message and stop workflow

**Benefit:** Prevents unauthorized users from consuming AI credits and accessing the service.

## 📌 Section 2: Message Type Detection

### 🎵 Audio/Voice Recognition
**Purpose:** Identifies the type of incoming message and audio format.

**Why it's needed:** Telegram handles different audio types with different statuses:
- Voice notes (voice messages)
- Audio files (standard audio attachments)
- Text messages (no audio content)

**Process:**
1. Check if message contains audio/voice content
2. If no audio file detected → Send "No audio file found" message
3. If audio detected → Assign file ID and proceed to format detection

### 🧩 File Type Determination (IF Node)
**Purpose:** Identifies the specific audio format for proper processing.

**Supported formats:**
- OGG (Telegram voice messages)
- MPEG/MP3
- MP4/M4A
- Other audio formats

**Logic:**

If format recognized → Proceed to transcription
If format not recognized → Send "File format not recognized" message

**Benefit:** Ensures compatibility with transcription services by validating file types upfront.

## 📌 Section 3: Primary Transcription (OpenAI)

### 📥 File Download
**Purpose:** Downloads the audio file from Telegram for processing.

### 🤖 OpenAI Transcription
**Purpose:** Transcribes audio to text using OpenAI's Whisper API.

**Why OpenAI:** High-quality transcription with cost-effective pricing.

**Process:**
1. Send downloaded file to OpenAI transcription API
2. Simultaneously send notification: "Transcription started"
3. If successful → Assign transcribed text to variable and proceed
4. If error occurs → Trigger fallback mechanism

**Benefit:** Fast, accurate transcription with multi-language support.

---

## 📌 Section 4: Fallback Transcription (Gemini)

### 🛟 Gemini Backup Transcription
**Purpose:** Provides a safety net if OpenAI transcription fails.

**Process:**
1. Receives file only if OpenAI node returns an error
2. Downloads and processes the same audio file
3. Sends to Google Gemini for transcription
4. Assigns transcribed text to the same text variable

**Benefit:** Ensures high reliability—if one service fails, the other takes over automatically.

---

## 📌 Section 5: Message Length Handling

### 📏 Text Length Check (IF Node)
**Purpose:** Determines if the transcribed text exceeds Telegram's character limit.

**Logic:**

If text ≤ 4000 characters → Send directly to Telegram
If text &gt; 4000 characters → Split into chunks

**Why:** Telegram has a 4,000-character limit per message.

### ✂️ Text Splitting (Code Node)
**Purpose:** Breaks long transcriptions into 4,000-character segments.

**Process:**
1. Receives text longer than 4,000 characters
2. Splits text into chunks of ≤4,000 characters
3. Maintains readability by avoiding mid-word breaks
4. Outputs array of text chunks

---

## 📌 Section 6: Response Delivery

### 💬 Send Transcription (Telegram Node)
**Purpose:** Delivers the transcribed text back to the Telegram group.

**Behavior:**
- **Short messages:** Sent as a single message
- **Long messages:** Sent as multiple sequential messages

**Benefit:** Users receive complete transcriptions regardless of length, ensuring no content is lost.
