## Description

This n8n template demonstrates how to build an intelligent entity research system that automatically discovers, researches, and creates comprehensive profiles for business entities, concepts, and terms.

Use cases are many: Try automating glossary creation for technical documentation, building standardized definition databases for compliance teams, researching industry terminology for content creation, or developing training materials with consistent entity explanations!

## Good to know

Each entity research typically costs $0.08-$0.34, depending on the complexity and sources required. The workflow includes smart duplicate detection to minimize unnecessary API calls.

The workflow requires multiple AI services and a vector database, so setup time may be longer than simpler templates.

Entity definitions are stored locally in your Qdrant database and can be reused across multiple projects.

## How it works

The workflow checks your existing knowledge base first to avoid duplicate research on entities you've already processed.

If the entity is new, an AI research agent intelligently combines your vector database, Wikipedia, and live web research to gather comprehensive information.

The system creates structured entity profiles with definitions, categories, examples, common misconceptions, and related entities - perfect for business documentation.

AI-powered validation ensures all entity profiles are complete, accurate, and suitable for business use before storage.

Each researched entity gets stored in your Qdrant vector database, creating a growing knowledge base that improves research efficiency over time.

The workflow includes multiple stages of duplicate prevention to avoid unnecessary processing and API costs.

## How to use

The manual trigger node is used as an example, but feel free to replace this with other triggers such as form submissions, content management systems, or automated content pipelines.

You can research multiple related entities in sequence, and the system will automatically identify connections and relationships between them.

Provide topic and audience context to get tailored explanations suitable for your specific business needs.

## Requirements

OpenAI API account for o4-mini (entity research and validation)
Qdrant vector database instance (local or cloud)
Ollama with nomic-embed-text model for embeddings
**Automate Web Research with GPT-4, Claude & Apify for Content Analysis and Insights** workflow (for live web research capabilities)
Anthropic API account for Claude Sonnet 4 (used by the web research workflow)
Apify account for web scraping (used by the web research workflow)

## Customizing this workflow

Entity research automation can be adapted for many specialized domains. Try focusing on specific industries like legal terminology (targeting official legal sources), medical concepts (emphasizing clinical accuracy), or financial terms (prioritizing regulatory definitions). You can also customize the validation criteria to match your organization's specific quality standards.
