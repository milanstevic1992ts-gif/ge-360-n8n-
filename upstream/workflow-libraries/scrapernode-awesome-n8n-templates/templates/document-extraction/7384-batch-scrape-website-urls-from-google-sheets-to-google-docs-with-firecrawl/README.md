> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*

# Firecrawl batch scraping to Google Docs
## Who's it for
AI chatbot developers, content managers, and data analysts who need to extract and organize content from multiple web pages for knowledge base creation, competitive analysis, or content migration projects.
## What it does
This workflow automatically scrapes content from a list of URLs and converts each page into a structured Google Doc in markdown format. It's designed for batch processing multiple pages efficiently, making it ideal for building AI knowledge bases, analyzing competitor content, or migrating website content to documentation systems.
## How it works
The workflow follows a systematic scraping process:

URL Input: Reads a list of URLs from a Google Sheets template
Data Validation: Filters out empty rows and already-processed URLs
Batch Processing: Loops through each URL sequentially
Content Extraction: Uses Firecrawl to scrape and convert content to markdown
Document Creation: Creates individual Google Docs for each scraped page
Progress Tracking: Updates the spreadsheet to mark completed URLs
Final Notification: Provides completion summary with access to scraped content

## Requirements

Firecrawl API key (for web scraping)
Google Sheets access
Google Drive access (for document creation)
Google Sheets template (provided)

## How to set up
### Step 1: Prepare your template

Copy the Google Sheets template
Create your own version for personal use
Ensure the sheet has a tab named "Page to doc"
List all URLs you want to scrape in the "URL" column

### Step 2: Configure API credentials
Set up the following credentials in n8n:

Firecrawl API: For web content scraping and markdown conversion
Google Sheets OAuth2: For reading URLs and updating progress
Google Drive OAuth2: For creating content documents

### Step 3: Set up your Google Drive folder

The workflow saves scraped content to a specific Drive folder
Default folder: "Contenu scrapé" (Content Scraped)
Folder ID: 1ry3xvQ9UqM2Rf9C4-AoJdg1lfB9inh_5 (customize this to your own folder)
Create your own folder and update the folder ID in the "Create file markdown scraping" node

### Step 4: Choose your trigger method
Option A: Chat interface

Use the default chat trigger
Send your Google Sheets URL through the chat interface

Option B: Manual trigger

Replace chat trigger with manual trigger
Set the Google Sheets URL as a variable in the "Get URL" node

## How to customize the workflow
### URL source customization

Sheet name: Change "Page to doc" to your preferred tab name
Column structure: Modify field mappings if using different column names
URL validation: Adjust filtering criteria for URL format requirements
Batch size: The workflow processes all URLs sequentially (no batch size limit)

### Scraping configuration

Firecrawl options: Add specific scraping parameters (wait times, JavaScript rendering)
Content format: Currently outputs markdown (can be modified for other formats)
Error handling: The workflow continues processing even if individual URLs fail
Retry logic: Add retry mechanisms for failed scraping attempts

### Output customization

Document naming: Currently uses the URL as document name (customizable)
Folder organization: Create subfolders for different content types
File format: Switch from Google Docs to other formats (PDF, TXT, etc.)
Content structure: Add headers, metadata, or formatting to scraped content

### Progress tracking enhancements

Status columns: Add more detailed status tracking (failed, retrying, etc.)
Metadata capture: Store scraping timestamps, content length, etc.
Error logging: Track which URLs failed and why
Completion statistics: Generate summary reports of scraping results

## Use cases
### AI knowledge base creation

E-commerce product pages: Scrape product descriptions and specifications for chatbot training
Documentation sites: Convert help articles into structured knowledge base content
FAQ pages: Extract customer service information for automated support systems
Company information: Gather about pages, services, and team information

### Content analysis and migration

Competitor research: Analyze competitor website content and structure
Content audits: Extract existing content for analysis and optimization
Website migrations: Backup content before site redesigns or platform changes
SEO analysis: Gather content for keyword and structure analysis

### Research and documentation

Market research: Collect information from multiple industry sources
Academic research: Gather content from relevant web sources
Legal compliance: Document website terms, policies, and disclaimers
Brand monitoring: Track content changes across multiple sites

## Workflow features
### Smart processing logic

Duplicate prevention: Skips URLs already marked as "Scrapé" (scraped)
Empty row filtering: Automatically ignores rows without URLs
Sequential processing: Handles one URL at a time to avoid rate limiting
Progress updates: Real-time status updates in the source spreadsheet

### Error handling and resilience

Graceful failures: Continues processing remaining URLs if individual scrapes fail
Status tracking: Clear indication of completed vs. pending URLs
Completion notification: Summary message with link to scraped content folder
Manual restart capability: Can resume processing from where it left off

## Results interpretation
### Organized content output
Each scraped page creates:

Individual Google Doc: Named with the source URL
Markdown formatting: Clean, structured content extraction
Metadata preservation: Original URL and scraping timestamp
Organized storage: All documents in designated Google Drive folder

### Progress tracking
The source spreadsheet shows:

URL list: Original URLs to be processed
Status column: "OK" for completed, empty for pending
Real-time updates: Progress visible during workflow execution
Completion summary: Final notification with access instructions

## Workflow limitations

Sequential processing: Processes URLs one at a time (prevents rate limiting but slower for large lists)
Google Drive dependency: Requires Google Drive for document storage
Firecrawl rate limits: Subject to Firecrawl API limitations and quotas
Single format output: Currently outputs only Google Docs (easily customizable)
Manual setup: Requires Google Sheets template preparation before use
No content deduplication: Creates separate documents even for similar content
