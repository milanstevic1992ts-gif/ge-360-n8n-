🛠️ Setup Instructions
Step 1: Google Sheet Prep

Create a Google Sheet with these columns (case-sensitive):

Name, Date of Birth, Patient ID, Date of Visit, Referring Physician, 
Department, Symptoms, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Temperature, 
Lab Results, Diagnosis, Medications, Next Appointment, Notes
Step 2: Mistral API Access

Sign up at Mistral AI
Get your API key
Ensure your plan supports file upload & OCR endpoints
Step 3: Google OAuth Credentials (Self-hosted or Cloud)

Go to n8n → Settings → Credentials, and add:

Google Sheets OAuth2
Scopes needed:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets
Step 4: Import Workflow

Go to Workflows &gt; Import from File
Upload your JSON file
Replace:
Google Sheet document ID in the "Google Sheets" node
Your Mistral API key in HTTP Header Auth
Step 5: (Optional) Make Form Public

In Cloud-based n8n:

You can expose the form as a public page
Otherwise, connect it to your website form via webhook
🧩 Customization Tips
Extract More Fields

Update the "Data cleaning" node and extend the list of fields:

const fields = ["Name", "Diagnosis", "Medications", "Symptoms", ...];
Add EHR or Database Integration

After Google Sheets, chain your custom system:

PostgreSQL
Airtable
Supabase
MongoDB
Change Output Format

Want JSON or Markdown output for internal tools?
Use the Set or Code node before the final output step.
