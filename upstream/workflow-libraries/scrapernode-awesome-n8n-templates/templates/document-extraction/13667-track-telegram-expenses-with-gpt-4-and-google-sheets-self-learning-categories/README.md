## Description

**💸 HOW IT WORKS — AI TELEGRAM EXPENSE TRACKER**

This workflow transforms natural Telegram messages into structured expenses using AI — without forms, manual typing, or complex inputs.

Simply send a message like:


*Groceries 23€ yesterday*



The workflow validates the sender, understands the intent, extracts structured data, and prepares the expense for approval before saving.

**🔄 WORKFLOW OVERVIEW**

**🟩 1. Secure Input Layer**
Incoming Telegram messages are checked against a list of approved Chat IDs to ensure only authorized users can create expenses.

**🟦 2. AI Expense Detection**
An AI layer analyzes the message and decides whether it represents a real financial transaction.
Non-expense messages are safely ignored to avoid noise in your data.

**🟨 3. Smart Category Intelligence**
Existing categories are loaded from Google Sheets and compared with the message content.
If no suitable category exists, the workflow can suggest and learn new categories over time.

**🟪 4. Structured Data Extraction**
AI converts natural language into structured fields:

date

amount

category

description

shared vs personal expense

Supports German and English input.

**🟥 5. Human Approval & Storage**
Before saving, the user confirms the extracted result directly via Telegram.
After approval, the expense is appended to Google Sheets automatically.
