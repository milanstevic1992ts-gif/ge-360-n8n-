- Analyses meeting content using AI models.
- Extracts key points, action items, questions, and themes from meetings automatically.

**AI-Powered Web App**

- Automatically creates a detailed report from past meetings.
- Stores meeting summaries, metadata, and insights into an easy-to-browse frontend.
- New meetings are added dynamically without manual work.
**
Knowledge Base Indexing (via Mem.ai)**

- Uploads extracted meeting data into a structured knowledge base.
- Supports categorisation, search and chat functionality across meetings.
- 
**Draft Follow-Up Emails**

- Draft personalised follow-up emails for meeting participants.
- Email drafts include:
    - Meeting summary
    - Key decisions
    - Action items
- Emails can be sent manually with a human in the loop context via Microsoft Outlook integration.

**Core Components**

- Microsoft Graph API for accessing meetings, chats, files, and user profiles.
- SharePoint API for file storage and search.
- n8n Webhooks to trigger processes dynamically.
- Generic OAuth2 authentication for seamless Microsoft access.
- JavaScript Code Nodes for flexible, intelligent parsing and structuring of meeting data.
- AI/LLM nodes for summarisation and content creation.

Designed to be scalable, modular, and easily customisable for different organisation sizes and industries.

🛡️ Note

Failure to correctly configure Azure permissions will prevent the template from functioning. Ensure admin approval is fully completed during setup.

## **Important Prerequisites**

⚠️ Administrator consent is required

This template requires a Microsoft 365 Global Administrator or Application Administrator to grant admin consent to a set of Microsoft Graph and SharePoint API scopes.

Basic Azure App Registration knowledge is required:

You need to set up an Azure App Registration manually, configure OAuth2 authentication, and assign specific API permissions.

A setup guide is included, but familiarity with:

- App registrations
- API permissions
- Client secrets
- OAuth2 flows

is highly recommended.

Knowledge of Postgres is required
The template includes a SQL script to create the required Postgres table (see blog post).

You are responsible for hosting your own database (You can use Supabase with the Postgres connection string).
