## Description

# Carbon Footprint Tracker with ScrapeGraphAI Analysis and ESG Reporting Automation

## 🎯 Target Audience
- Sustainability managers and ESG officers
- Environmental compliance teams
- Corporate social responsibility (CSR) managers
- Energy and facilities managers
- Supply chain sustainability coordinators
- Environmental consultants
- Green building certification teams
- Climate action plan coordinators
- Regulatory compliance officers
- Corporate reporting and disclosure teams

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Manual carbon footprint calculation and ESG reporting is complex, time-consuming, and often inaccurate due to fragmented data sources and outdated emission factors. This template solves the challenge of automatically collecting environmental data, calculating accurate carbon footprints, identifying reduction opportunities, and generating comprehensive ESG reports using AI-powered data collection and automated sustainability workflows.

## 🔧 How it Works

This workflow automatically collects energy and transportation data using ScrapeGraphAI, calculates comprehensive carbon footprints across all three scopes, identifies reduction opportunities, and generates automated ESG reports for sustainability compliance and reporting.

### Key Components

1. **Schedule Trigger** - Runs automatically every day at 8:00 AM to collect environmental data
2. **Energy Data Scraper** - Uses ScrapeGraphAI to extract energy consumption data and emission factors
3. **Transport Data Scraper** - Collects transportation emission factors and fuel efficiency data
4. **Footprint Calculator** - Calculates comprehensive carbon footprint across Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions
5. **Reduction Opportunity Finder** - Identifies cost-effective carbon reduction opportunities
6. **Sustainability Dashboard** - Creates comprehensive sustainability metrics and KPIs
7. **ESG Report Generator** - Automatically generates ESG compliance reports
8. **Create Reports Folder** - Organizes reports in Google Drive
9. **Save Report to Drive** - Stores final reports for stakeholder access

## 📊 Carbon Footprint Analysis Specifications

The template calculates and tracks the following emission categories:

| Emission Scope | Category | Data Sources | Calculation Method | Example Output |
|----------------|----------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Scope 1 (Direct)** | Natural Gas | EPA emission factors | Consumption × 11.7 lbs CO2/therm | 23,400 lbs CO2 |
| **Scope 1 (Direct)** | Fleet Fuel | EPA fuel economy data | Miles ÷ MPG × 19.6 lbs CO2/gallon | 11,574 lbs CO2 |
| **Scope 2 (Electricity)** | Grid Electricity | EPA emission factors | kWh × 0.92 lbs CO2/kWh | 46,000 lbs CO2 |
| **Scope 3 (Indirect)** | Employee Commute | EPA transportation data | Miles × 0.77 lbs CO2/mile | 19,250 lbs CO2 |
| **Scope 3 (Indirect)** | Air Travel | EPA aviation factors | Miles × 0.53 lbs CO2/mile | 26,500 lbs CO2 |
| **Scope 3 (Indirect)** | Supply Chain | Estimated factors | Electricity × 0.1 multiplier | 4,600 lbs CO2 |
