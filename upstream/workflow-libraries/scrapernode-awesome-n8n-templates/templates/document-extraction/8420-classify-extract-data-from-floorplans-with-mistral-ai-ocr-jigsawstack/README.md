If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

<section>
  <h2>🌊 What it Does</h2>
  <p>
    This workflow <strong>automatically classifies uploaded files</strong> (PDFs or images) as
    <span>floorplans</span> or <span>non‑floorplans</span>.  
    It filters out junk files, then analyzes valid floorplans to extract <em>room sizes</em> and <em>measurements</em>.
  </p>

  <h2>👥 Who it’s For</h2>
  <p>
    Built for <strong>real estate platforms, property managers, and automation builders</strong> 
    who need a trustworthy way to detect invalid uploads while quickly turning true floorplans 
    into structured, reusable data.
  </p>

  <h2>⚙️ How it Works</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>User uploads a file (<code>PDF</code>, <code>JPG</code>, <code>PNG</code>, etc.).</li>
    <li>Workflow routes the file based on type for specialized processing.</li>
    <li>A two‑layer quality check is applied using heuristics and AI classification.</li>
    <li>A confidence score determines if the file is a valid floorplan.</li>
    <li>Valid floorplans are passed to a powerful OCR/AI for deep analysis.</li>
    <li>Results are returned as <strong>JSON</strong> and a user-friendly <strong>HTML table</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>🧠 The Technology Behind the Demo</h2>
  <p>
    This MVP is a glimpse into a more advanced commercial system. It runs on a custom <strong>n8n workflow</strong> that leverages <strong>Mistral AI's</strong> latest OCR technology. Here’s what makes it powerful:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Structured Data Extraction:</strong> The AI is forced to return data in a clean, predictable <code>JSON Schema</code>. This isn't just text scraping; it’s a reliable data pipeline.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Intelligent Data Enrichment:</strong> The workflow doesn't just extract data—it enriches it. A custom script automatically calculates crucial metrics like <strong>wall surface area</strong> from the floor dimensions, even using fallback estimates if needed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Automated Aggregation:</strong> It goes beyond individual rooms by automatically calculating totals per floor level and per room type, providing immediate, actionable insights.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    While this demo shows the core classification and measurement (Step 1), the full commercial version includes <strong>Step 2 & 3 (Automated Offer Generation)</strong>, currently in use by a client in the construction industry.
