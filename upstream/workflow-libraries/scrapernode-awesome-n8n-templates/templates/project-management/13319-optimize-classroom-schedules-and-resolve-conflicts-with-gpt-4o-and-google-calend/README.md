## Description

## How It Works
This workflow automates competitive intelligence gathering and market analysis for businesses needing real-time insights on competitors, industry trends, and market positioning. Designed for marketing teams, strategy analysts, and business development professionals, it solves the time-intensive challenge of manually monitoring competitor activities across multiple channels. The system schedules regular data collection, fetches competitor information from various sources, employs multiple AI agents (OpenAI for analysis, sentiment evaluation, and report generation) to process data, validates outputs through structured parsing, and delivers comprehensive reports via email. By automating data aggregation, sentiment analysis, and insight generation, organizations gain actionable intelligence faster, identify market opportunities proactively, and maintain competitive advantage through continuous monitoring—essential for dynamic markets where timing determines success.

## Setup Steps
1. Connect **Schedule Trigger** (set monitoring frequency: daily/weekly)
2. Configure **Fetch Data** node with competitor website URLs/APIs
3. Add **OpenAI API keys** to all AI agent nodes 
4. Link **Google Sheets** credentials for storing historical analysis data
5. Configure **Gmail** node with SMTP credentials for report distribution
6. Set up **Slack/Discord** webhooks for instant critical alert notifications
