> ⚡ **258 views** · 📋 [Project Management](../)

## Description

## Description

This workflow sends an instant email alert when a task in a Google Sheet is marked as Urgent, and then sends a Telegram reminder notification after 2 hours if the task still hasn’t been updated. Then a Jira ticket is created so the task enters in the formal workflow and another Telegram message is sent with the details of the issue created.

It helps teams avoid missed deadlines and ensures urgent tasks get attention — without requiring anyone to refresh or monitor the sheet manually.

## Context

In shared task lists, urgent items can be overlooked if team members aren't actively checking the spreadsheet.
This workflow solves that by:

- Sending an email as soon as a task becomes Urgent

- Waiting 2 hours

- Checking if the task is still open

- Sending a Telegram reminder only if action has not been taken

- Creating a Jira issue

- Sending a Telegram message with the details of the issue created


- This prevents both silence and spam, creating a smart and reliable alert system.

## Target Users
- Project Managers using Google Sheets

- Team leads managing shared task boards

- Remote teams needing lightweight coordination

- Anyone who wants escalation notifications without complex systems

## Technical Requirements
- Google Sheets credential
- Gmail credential
- Telegram Bot + Chat ID
- Google Sheet with a column named Priority
- Jira credential

## Workflow Steps

- Mark Notified = Yes in the sheet
- Wait 2 hours
- IF Status is still not resolved
- Send Telegram reminder
- create an Issue on Jira based on the information provided
- Send Telegram message with the details of the ticket

## Key Features
