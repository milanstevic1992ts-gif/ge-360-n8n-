> ⚡ **104 views** · 📋 [Project Management](../)

## Description

## Description

This workflow sends a personalized email when a task in a Google Sheet is marked as Urgent, but only once per task.

It prevents duplicate notifications by updating the sheet after the email is sent. Ideal for collaborative task tracking where multiple people edit the same spreadsheet.

## Context

When working with shared task lists in Google Sheets, it’s easy to miss critical updates — or worse, trigger multiple alerts for the same task.

This workflow ensures that each "Urgent" task only sends one email notification, and then marks it as “Notified” to avoid duplicates.

## Target Users
- Project Managers using Google Sheets
- Operations or support teams managing collaborative task boards
- Anyone who needs alert automation with built-in anti-spam logic

## Technical Requirements

- Google Sheets account with edit access

- Gmail account for sending notifications

- Google Sheet with columns:

	- Priority

	- Notified

	- Task

	- Owner

	- Deadline

	- Status

	- Next Step

## Workflow Steps

- Trigger: Watches for changes in Google Sheets (e.g., edits to the "Priority" column)

- IF Node – Checks that:

- Priority = Urgent

- Notified is empty

- row exists (required for update)

- Send Email: Sends a personalized message with task details

- Update Row:  Writes “Yes” in the Notified column to avoid duplicate alerts

## Setup Instructions

- Connect your Google Sheets and Gmail credentials in n8n.
