# Workflow: Auto-Ticket Maker

## ⚡ About the Creators
This workflow was created by [Varritech Technologies](https://varritech.com), an innovative agency that leverages AI to engineer, design, and deliver software development projects 500% faster than traditional agencies. Based in New York City, we specialize in custom software development, web applications, and digital transformation solutions. If you need assistance implementing this workflow or have questions about content management solutions, please reach out to our team.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
This workflow transforms your Slack conversations into complete project tickets, effectively replacing the need for a dedicated PM for task creation:

Slack Webhook → Captures team conversation
Code Transformation → Parses Slack message structure
AI PM Agent → Analyzes requirements and creates complete tickets
Memory Buffer → Maintains conversation context
Slack Output → Returns formatted tickets to your channel

Say goodbye to endless PM meetings just to create tickets! Simply describe what you need in Slack, and our AI PM handles the rest, breaking down complex projects into structured epics and tasks with all the necessary details.
