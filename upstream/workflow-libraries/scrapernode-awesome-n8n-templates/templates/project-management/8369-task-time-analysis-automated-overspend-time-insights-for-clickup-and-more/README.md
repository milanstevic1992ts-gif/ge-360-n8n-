# 📋 Task time analysis: Automated overspend time insights for ClickUp and more

> ⚡ **133 views** · 📋 [Project Management](../)

## Description

This workflow automatically analyses tasks to uncover why the actual time spent exceeds the original estimates. It connects with ClickUp(Can do with any PMS like JIRA, Asana, Monday and more) and other project management tools to generate clear insights on overspending trends. Save time, improve planning accuracy, and boost team productivity with automated task time analysis with two types of reports.

- **“Why needed extra time?”** – Reasons users requested extensions or faced blockers.

- **“Why went over estimate?”** – Reasons the actual work exceeded the original estimation.


# 🔧 **Workflow Overview**

1. **Manual Trigger**
Kick off execution by clicking **“Test workflow”.**

2. **Fetch Relevant Tasks**
Calls ClickUp to retrieve all tasks in specified states (“internal review” or “in progress”) that belong to designated folders and assignees.

3. **Filter by Overrun**
Filters tasks to include only those where time_spent &gt; time_estimate.

4. **Gather Details**
For each overrun task:
	- Fetch **time entries** via ClickUp API.
	- Fetch **all comments**, including threaded replies.
	- Retain only essential task fields and reformat timestamps.

5. **Normalize and Merge**
- Extracts and sorts comment threads into clean arrays.
- Sorts time entry intervals chronologically.
- Merges task metadata, comments, and time entries into a single payload.

6. **Pass to AI Agent**
Sends consolidated task data to a ChatGPT-powered node using a custom prompt that:

	- Extracts **all** “extra time requests” from comments and time entries.
	- Identifies **debugging**, **research**, **clarification**, or **rework** intervals exceeding estimates.
	- Combines findings into two distinct checklists.

7. **Format JSON Output**
A final Code node parses AI output into a clean JSON array ready for conversion.

8. **Convert to File**
JSON result for each task is prepared for file attachment or external storage.


## 🧩 Key Nodes & Functions

|Node Name|Responsibility|
|-|-|
|Get ClickUp Tasks|Retrieves tasks by filter criteria|
|If task has crossed estimation|Ensures only tasks with overruns continue|
|Fetch Time entries via task IDs|Retrieves detailed time intervals|
|Fetch Master comments|Retrieves all comments and threads|
|Split → Merge scripting nodes|Clean and normalize comments structure|
|Modify Time/Task data|Trims and prepares JSON for AI processing|
|OpenAI Chat Model + AI Agent|Applies a GPT-based prompt to generate two reasoned checklists in JSON format|
|Convert to File|Prepares final output as a JSON file or store on Sreadsheet or Email or Excel|


## 🛠 Customization Tips
- **Trigger Automation:** Integrate a scheduled node for periodic runs (e.g., daily).
- **Filter Scope:** Adjust ClickUp filters for different task types, spaces, or statuses.
- **AI Prompt Tuning:** Refine prompt to include severity, link references, or categorize reasons.
- **Output Handling:** Use the JSON file in subsequent n8n nodes for notifications *(Slack, Email, Spreadsheet, Airtable, ExcelSheet, etc.)* or analytics.

## ✅ Benefits at a Glance

- Automates time-overrun analysis, eliminating manual review.
- Extracts insights directly from tasks description, comments, and timesheets.
- Produces structured outputs ideal for management dashboards or retrospectives.
- Customizable for team-specific workflows or reporting needs.
