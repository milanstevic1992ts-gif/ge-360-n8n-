## Description

## This n8n template implements a Calendly Booking & Cancellation Automation Hub that automatically processes Calendly webhook events, logs data to Google Sheets, and sends intelligent Slack notifications

## Who's it for

This template is designed for **professionals, teams, and businesses** who use Calendly for scheduling and want to automate their booking management workflow. It's perfect for:

- **Sales teams** who need instant notifications about new bookings and cancellations
- **Service providers** (consultants, coaches, therapists) who want to track appointments automatically
- **Businesses** that need centralized logging of all booking events for analytics
- **Teams** that want smart categorization of urgent bookings and last-minute cancellations
- **Organizations** requiring automated follow-up workflows based on booking status

## How it works / What it does

This workflow creates a **comprehensive Calendly automation system** that automatically processes booking confirmations and cancellations. The system:

1. **Listens for Calendly events** via webhook trigger for:
   - `invitee.created` - New booking confirmations
   - `invitee.canceled` - Booking cancellations

2. **Routes events intelligently** using a Switch node to separate booking and cancellation processing

3. **For Bookings:**
   - Extracts and transforms all booking data (invitee info, event details, timing, location, guests)
   - Calculates computed fields (formatted dates/times, duration, days until event, urgency flags)
   - **Detects urgent bookings** (same-day or next-day appointments) for priority handling
   - Logs complete booking information to Google Sheets
   - Sends formatted Slack notifications with meeting links, reschedule/cancel options

4. **For Cancellations:**
   - Extracts cancellation details (reason, who canceled, timing)
   - **Categorizes cancellations** into three types:
     - **Last Minute** (within 24 hours of event) - High priority follow-up
     - **Standard** (upcoming events) - Normal priority
     - **Past Event** (already occurred) - Low priority
   - Calculates hours before event for timing analysis
   - Logs cancellation data to Google Sheets
   - Sends categorized Slack alerts with follow-up priority indicators

5. **Data Management:**
   - Stores all bookings in a dedicated Google Sheets tab
   - Stores all cancellations in a separate Google Sheets tab
   - Maintains complete event history for analytics and reporting

## How to set up

### 1. Configure Calendly Webhook Trigger
- Go to [developer.calendly.com](https://developer.calendly.com)
- Create an OAuth2 application or use Personal Access Token
- In n8n, add Calendly OAuth2 credentials
- The workflow automatically registers webhooks for `invitee.created` and `invitee.canceled` events
- Ensure your Calendly account has the necessary permissions

### 2. Set up Google Sheets
- Create a Google Sheets spreadsheet with two tabs:
  - **Bookings** - For logging new booking confirmations
  - **Cancellations** - For logging cancelled appointments
- Configure Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials in n8n
- Update the document ID in both Google Sheets nodes:
  - "Log to Bookings Sheet1" node
  - "Log to Cancellations Sheet" node
- The workflow uses auto-mapping, so ensure your sheet headers match the data fields

### 3. Configure Slack Notifications
- Create a Slack app at [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com)
- Add Bot Token Scopes: `chat:write`, `channels:read`
- Install the app to your workspace
- Add Slack OAuth2 credentials in n8n
- Update the channel name in both Slack nodes (default: "general")
- Customize notification messages if needed

### 4. Test the Workflow
- Activate the workflow in n8n
- Create a test booking in Calendly
- Verify that:
  - Data appears in Google Sheets
  - Slack notification is received
  - All fields are correctly populated
- Test cancellation flow by canceling a booking

### 5. Customize (Optional)
- Adjust urgency detection logic (currently same-day or next-day)

## Workflow Architecture

The workflow uses a **routing pattern** to handle different event types:

1. **Calendly Webhook Trigger** → Receives all events
2. **Route Event Type (Switch)** → Separates bookings from cancellations
3. **Parallel Processing** → Each path processes independently
4. **Data Transformation** → Set nodes extract and format data
5. **Intelligent Routing** → IF/Switch nodes categorize by urgency/type
6. **Data Logging** → Google Sheets stores all events
7. **Notifications** → Slack alerts team members

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Booking
1. Customer books a 30-minute consultation for tomorrow
2. Workflow detects it's a next-day booking (urgent)
3. Data logged to "Bookings" sheet with urgency flag
4. Slack notification sent with 🚨 URGENT label
5. Team member receives instant alert

### Scenario 2: Last-Minute Cancellation
1. Customer cancels meeting 2 hours before scheduled time
2. Workflow categorizes as "last-minute" cancellation
3. Data logged to "Cancellations" sheet with high priority
4. Slack alert sent with 🚨 LAST MINUTE label
5. Team can immediately follow up or fill the slot

### Scenario 3: Standard Cancellation
1. Customer cancels meeting 3 days in advance
2. Workflow categorizes as "standard" cancellation
3. Data logged with normal priority
4. Slack notification sent with standard formatting
5. Team can plan accordingly

This template transforms your Calendly scheduling into a fully automated booking management system, ensuring no booking goes unnoticed and providing valuable insights into your scheduling patterns and customer behavior.
