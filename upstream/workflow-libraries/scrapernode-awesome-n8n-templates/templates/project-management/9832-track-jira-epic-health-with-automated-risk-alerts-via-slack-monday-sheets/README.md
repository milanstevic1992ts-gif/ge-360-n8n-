## Description

## Description:
Transform your Jira project management workflow with this intelligent n8n automation template that continuously tracks, scores, and reports the health of Jira Epics.

The automation runs every 6 hours, fetches all active Epics, analyzes linked issues for performance, quality, and stability metrics, and automatically flags at-risk Epics. It updates Jira fields, sends alerts to Slack, logs trends in Google Sheets, and syncs visibility with Monday.com—ensuring teams stay proactive, not reactive.
Ideal for agile teams, project managers, and product owners looking to monitor delivery health, detect risks early, and maintain transparent reporting across tools.

## ✅ What This Template Does (Step-by-Step)
⏱ Trigger Every 6 Hours: Automatically executes every six hours to keep health data updated in near real-time.
📥 Fetch All Epics from Jira: Retrieves all Epics, their keys, and fields via the Jira API to establish a full analysis scope.
🔀 Split Epics for Processing: Converts the batch of Epics into individual items, enabling sequential metric analysis.
🔗 Fetch Linked Issues: Collects all issues linked to each Epic, capturing their types, statuses, cycle times, and labels for deeper health analysis.
📈 Calculate Health Score: Computes a weighted score (0–1 scale) based on:
 • 40% Average Cycle Time
 • 30% Bug Ratio
 • 20% Churn (Reopened issues)
 • 10% Blocker Ratio
 Scores above 0.6 indicate at-risk Epics.
⚖️ Decision Gate: At-Risk or Healthy: If the health score exceeds 0.6, the workflow automatically initiates corrective actions.
🔧 Update Jira Epic: Updates Jira with the computed health score and adds an “At Risk” label for visibility in dashboards and filters.
🚨 Send Slack Alerts: Notifies the #project-alerts channel with Epic details, health score, and direct Jira links for immediate attention.
📋 Update Monday.com Pulse: Syncs health metrics and risk status back to your Monday board, maintaining cross-platform transparency.
📊 Log to Google Sheets: Appends health score logs with timestamps and Epic keys for trend analysis, audits, and dashboard creation.
