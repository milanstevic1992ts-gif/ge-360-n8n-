> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

## Description

## Description
![AI Social Publisher via PostPulse.png](fileId:2755)

This workflow allows you to turn any idea for a post into platform-specific content using AI. You simply provide the concept, topic, or description of a post, and the AI generates drafts adapted to multiple social media platforms — LinkedIn, Telegram, TikTok, YouTube, X/Twitter, Instagram, Bluesky and Threads. Posts are created in [PostPulse](https://post-pulse.com/) ready for review, scheduling, or publishing. 

⚠️ ***Disclaimer:*** This workflow uses the community node **@postpulse/n8n-nodes-postpulse**. Make sure community nodes are enabled in your n8n instance before importing and using this template.
👉 **To install it:** Go to Settings → Community Nodes → Install and enter:"@postpulse/n8n-nodes-postpulse".
💡 **For more details, see n8n Integration Guide:**[ PostPulse Developers – n8n Integration](https://developers.post-pulse.com/n8n-integration)
