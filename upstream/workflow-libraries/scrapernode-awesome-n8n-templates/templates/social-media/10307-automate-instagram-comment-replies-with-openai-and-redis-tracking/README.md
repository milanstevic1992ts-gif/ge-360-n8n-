> ⚡ **787 views** · 📱 [Social Media & Email Marketing](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Heads up — if this workflow's Instagram scraping breaks (it happens whenever Meta updates their frontend), [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/instagram) is a community node that handles [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/profiles), [posts](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/posts), [reels](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/reels), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/comments) without any HTML parsing.

## Description

This workflow automatically replies to new comments on your Instagram posts using smart AI.  
It checks your recent posts, finds unread comments, and skips spam or duplicates.  
The AI reads the post and comments to create a friendly, natural reply with emojis.  
It posts the reply instantly and logs everything so you can track engagement.  
Perfect for busy creators — stays active 24/7 without you lifting a finger!

## What It Monitors
- **Recent Instagram Posts**: Fetches the latest posts based on your account activity.
- **New Comments**: Detects unreplied comments in real time.
- **Reply Eligibility**: Filters spam, duplicates, and already replied comments.
- **AI-Generated Responses**: Creates personalized, engaging replies using post context.

## Features
- Runs on a **schedule trigger** (High traffic: 2–3 min | Medium: 5 min | Low: 10+ min).
- Fetches **recent posts** and their **comments** via Instagram Graph API.
- **Context-aware AI replies** using post caption + comment content.
- **Spam & duplicate filtering** to avoid unwanted or repeated replies.
- **Tone-friendly & emoji-rich** responses for higher engagement.
- **Logs every reply** with metadata (post ID, comment ID, timestamp).


## Workflow Steps

| Node Name | Description |

| **Schedule Trigger** | Triggers workflow based on traffic level (2–10 min intervals). |
| **Get Recent Posts** | Fetches recent posts using Instagram Graph API. Returns post IDs needed to fetch comments. |
| **Split Posts** | Splits batch of posts into individual items for parallel processing. |
| **Get Comments** | For each post, retrieves comments with content, username, timestamp, like count. |
| **Split Comments** | Splits comments into individual items for granular processing. |

| **Spam Filter** | Filters out spam using: <br>• Spam keywords <br>• Empty/one-word comments <br>• Excessive emojis <br>• Known spam patterns |
| **Should Reply?** | Final logic gate: <br>• If reply key exists → Skip <br>• If spam → Skip <br>• Else → Proceed |
| **Generate AI Reply** | Uses OpenAI (or compatible LLM): <br>• Input: Post caption + comment <br>• Tone: Friendly & engaging <br>• Max tokens: 150 <br>• Temperature: 0.8 (creative) |
| **Post Reply** | Posts AI-generated reply via Instagram API: <br>• Method: POST <br>• Body: message parameter <br>• TTL: 30 days |
| **Mark As Replied** | Updates internal tracking to prevent duplicate replies. |
