> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Twitter's API is paid now, which makes simple data pulls expensive. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/twitter) is a community node that scrapes [Twitter profiles](https://scrapernode.com/twitter/scrapers/profiles) and [posts](https://scrapernode.com/twitter/scrapers/posts) without needing API access.

3. **set API Key** – Securely insert your Perplexity API key.
4. **Perplexity API Call** – Fetches a short, insightful response to your query.
5. **Post to X** – Automatically publishes the result as a tweet.
