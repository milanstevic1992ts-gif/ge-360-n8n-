> 💡 **Pro Tip** — YouTube's API quotas can be a bottleneck when you're pulling data at scale. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/youtube) is a community node with dedicated scrapers for [channels](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/channels), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/videos), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/comments) — no quota limits, just structured data.

## Description

# YouTube to X Post

## Overview

This **n8n workflow** automates the process of promoting your latest YouTube videos on **X (formerly Twitter)**. It ensures that posts are engaging, concise, and follow platform-specific requirements. Additionally, the workflow logs social posts into a **Google Sheet** for record-keeping.

## Features

- **Fetch Latest YouTube Videos:** Pulls recently uploaded videos from a specified channel.
- **Generate Engaging X Posts:** Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to create tailored, witty posts about your videos.
- **Character Limit Validation:** Ensures posts comply with X's character limit by rewriting if necessary.
- **Post Scheduling:** Automates post publishing to X.
- **Google Sheets Integration:** Logs posts and their status for tracking and management.
- **Optional Notifications:** Sends updates via Discord, Slack, or Gmail (disabled by default).
