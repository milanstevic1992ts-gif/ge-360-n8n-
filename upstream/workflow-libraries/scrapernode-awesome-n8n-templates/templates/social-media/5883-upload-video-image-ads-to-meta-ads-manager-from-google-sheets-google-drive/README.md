# Upload Video & Image Ads to Meta Ads Manager from Google Sheets using Google Drive & Meta Graph API

## Product Description

This n8n workflow automates the process of uploading video and image advertisements to Meta Ads Manager via the Meta Graph API (Facebook Ads) directly from Google Sheets and Google Drive. The workflow monitors a specified Google Drive folder for new assets, extracts file metadata, and creates Facebook ad campaigns with customizable creative elements including multiple text variations, headlines, and descriptions.

The automation supports both video and image assets, with intelligent handling of single or multiple image creatives. For video assets, it manages the upload process, monitors processing status, and automatically generates preview thumbnails. Image assets can be configured with multiple variations and custom placement targeting across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and Audience Network.

## Workflow Triggers

The workflow can be activated through:
- **Manual Trigger**: For testing and one-time executions
- **Google Drive Trigger**: Automatic execution when files are added/updated
- **Webhook Trigger**: Integration with Google Apps Script for direct sheet control
- **Custom Menu Integration**: Upload ads directly from Google Sheets via "Meta → Upload Ads" menu option

### Using the Custom Menu
The Google Sheets template includes a custom Google Apps Script that adds a "Meta" menu to your spreadsheet. To upload ads:

1. Ensure the webhook URL is correctly configured in the Settings tab
2. Navigate to the "Meta" menu in your Google Sheet
3. Click "Upload Ads" to trigger the workflow
4. The workflow will process all ads marked for upload in the "Ready to Upload" sheet

## File Support

- **Large File Handling**: Includes workaround for Google Drive virus scanning on large files

## Important Notes

- All ads are created in "PAUSED" status for review before activation
- The workflow includes built-in delays to respect API rate limits
- Asset processing status is monitored and updated in real-time
- Multiple text variations enable A/B testing capabilities
