> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

## Description

**Automate TikTok video posting from Google Sheets & Drive with Blotato. Perfect for content creators and social media managers.**

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT
**Self-hosted n8n only** - requires community nodes not available in cloud version.

## Google Sheets Structure
Required columns: **ID**, **Media URL**, **Caption**, **Status**
- Videos must be in Google Drive
- Status must be "pending" for processing
- Captions can include hashtags (5 max recommended)

## How it works
1. **Schedule Trigger** → Runs every hour
2. **Fetch Data** → Gets pending videos from Google Sheets
3. **Process Video** → Extracts Drive ID and shares file
4. **Upload** → Transfers to Blotato platform
5. **Post** → Automatically posts to TikTok
6. **Update Status** → Marks as "posted" in spreadsheet

## Requirements
- Self-hosted n8n instance
