## Description

This workflow automates the entire lifecycle of collecting, filtering, summarizing, and delivering the most important daily news in **technology, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and the digital industry**.
It functions as a **fully autonomous editorial engine**, combining dozens of RSS feeds, structured data processing, and an LLM (Google Gemini) to transform a large volume of raw articles into a concise, high–value daily briefing delivered straight to your inbox.

## ✅ **1. Scheduled Automation**

The workflow begins with a **Schedule Trigger**, which runs at predefined intervals.
Every execution generates a fresh briefing that reflects the most relevant news from the **past 24 hours**.

---

## ✅ **2. Massive Multi-Source RSS Collection**

The workflow gathers content from over 25 curated RSS feeds covering:

### **🔐 Cybersecurity**

(The Hacker News, Krebs on Security, SANS, CVE feeds, Google Cloud Threat Intelligence, Cisco Talos, etc.)

### **🤖 Artificial Intelligence**

(Google Research, MIT News, AI News, OpenAI News)

### **💻 Technology & Digital Industry**

(Il Sole 24 Ore, Cybersecurity360, Graham Cluley, and more)

### **⚙️ Nvidia Ecosystem**

(Nvidia Newsroom, Nvidia Developer Blog, Nvidia Blog)

Each RSS feed is handled by a **dedicated node**, which ensures:

* source isolation
* easier debugging
* no single point of failure

The feeds are grouped using category-specific **Merge** nodes (Cyber1/2/3, AI, Nvidia), enabling modular scalability.

---

## ✅ **3. Unified Feed Aggregation**

All category merges feed into the **Merge_All** node, creating a single combined dataset of articles from every source.

---

## ✅ **4. Intelligent Filtering (last 24 hours only)**

The **Filter** node removes:

* articles older than **24 hours** (based on `isoDate`)
* invalid items
* duplicated or redundant entries

This keeps the briefing strictly relevant to the current day.

---

## ✅ **5. Chronological Sorting**

The **Sort – Articles by Date** node orders all remaining items in descending date order.
More recent or time-sensitive news is therefore prioritized.

---

## ✅ **6. Data Normalization (JavaScript Code)**

A dedicated Code node transforms all incoming items into **one clean JSON object**:

```json
{
  "articles": [
    {
      "title": "...",
      "content": "...",
      "link": "...",
      "isoDate": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

This standardized structure becomes the input for the LLM summarization stage.

---

## ✅ **7. AI Editorial Processing – Google Gemini**

The node **LLM – News Summarizer** is the workflow’s editorial brain.

A complex prompt instructs Gemini to behave like the **editor-in-chief of a major tech newspaper**, enforcing strict rules:

### Selection rules:

* choose only **8–10 truly important stories**
* ignore low-value content (minor product releases, clickbait, rumors…)

### Relevance criteria:

* AI research & foundation models
* Big Tech developments
* cybersecurity incidents
* regulation and digital policy
* semiconductors, cloud, and infrastructure
* digital rights, governance, sovereignty

### Deduplication:

If multiple feeds report the same story, only one version is kept.

### Output format:

Gemini must output **a valid JSON object** containing:

* `subject`: the email subject line
* `html`: a fully structured HTML body grouped into categories

Each news item ends with a **clickable HTML source link**, NEVER plaintext URLs.

This step condenses dozens of articles into a **polished, editorial-grade briefing**.

---

## ✅ **8. HTML Newsletter Assembly (Code Node)**

The **Build Final Newsletter HTML** node:

* safely parses the JSON from the LLM
* cleans any ```json fences or extra text
* validates `subject` and `html` fields
* embeds the content into a **modern, responsive HTML email template**

The output is a single item containing:

* the final email subject
* the final HTML body
  Ready to be sent.

---

## ✅ **9. Automatic Email Delivery**

The **Send Final Digest Email** (Gmail node):

* uses the generated subject
* sends the curated HTML newsletter
* delivers it to the configured recipient(s)
* uses a custom sender name (“n8n News”)

The result is a fully automated **Tech & AI Daily Briefing** delivered with zero manual effort.

---
