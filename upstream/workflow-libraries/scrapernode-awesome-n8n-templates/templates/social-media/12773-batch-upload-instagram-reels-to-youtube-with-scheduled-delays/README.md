# 📱 Batch upload Instagram Reels to YouTube with scheduled delays

> ⚡ **163 views** · 📱 [Social Media & Email Marketing](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Heads up — if this workflow's Instagram scraping breaks (it happens whenever Meta updates their frontend), [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/instagram) is a community node that handles [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/profiles), [posts](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/posts), [reels](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/reels), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/comments) without any HTML parsing.

## Description

Automatically upload your Instagram videos to YouTube with configurable time gaps between each upload, using n8n Tables for deduplication.

---

## How it works

1. **Fetches recent Instagram posts** via the Meta Graph API and filters to only video content (VIDEO/REELS)
2. **Checks each video against an n8n Table** to skip already-uploaded content
3. **Waits a configurable delay** between uploads to space out your publishing schedule
4. **Processes metadata** - extracts title from caption, converts hashtags to YouTube tags
5. **Uploads to YouTube** with your configured privacy, category, and safety settings
6. **Records the upload** in the n8n Table to prevent duplicates on future runs

---

## Set up steps

**Time estimate: 10-15 minutes**

1. Create an **n8n Table** with two text fields: `postId` and `youtubeId`
2. Connect your **Instagram credentials** (Meta Developer Bearer Token)
3. Connect your **YouTube OAuth2** account
4. Edit the **Configuration node** to set your preferred upload delay, privacy status, and category
5. Activate the workflow

*Detailed setup instructions and configuration options are documented in the sticky notes inside the workflow.*

## Required n8n Table

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `postId` | String | Stores the Instagram post ID to prevent re-uploading |
| `youtubeId` | String | Stores the resulting YouTube video ID for reference |

**How to create:**
1. Go to **n8n Tables** in your n8n instance
2. Create a new table named "Instagram To YouTube"
3. Add two columns: `postId` (text) and `youtubeId` (text)
4. Select this table in both the "Check If Already Uploaded" and "Save Upload Record" nodes

---

## Configuration Options

Edit the **Configuration** node to customize:

```json
{
  "includeSourceLink": true,      // Include Instagram link in description
  "waitTimeoutSeconds": 900,      // Delay between uploads (900 = 15 min)
  "maxTitleLength": 100,          // Maximum YouTube title length
  "categoryId": "24",             // YouTube category (24 = Entertainment)
  "privacyStatus": "public",      // public, private, or unlisted
  "notifySubscribers": false,     // Send notifications to subscribers
  "defaultLanguage": "en",        // Video language code
  "ageRestricted": false          // Mark as 18+ content
}
```

### Key Settings Explained

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `includeSourceLink` | `true` | Set to `false` if your YouTube account can't add external links (unverified accounts) |
| `waitTimeoutSeconds` | `900` | Gap between uploads in seconds. 900 = 15 minutes, 3600 = 1 hour |
| `ageRestricted` | `false` | Set to `true` if your content is for mature audiences (18+) |
| `notifySubscribers` | `false` | Set to `true` to notify subscribers on each upload |
