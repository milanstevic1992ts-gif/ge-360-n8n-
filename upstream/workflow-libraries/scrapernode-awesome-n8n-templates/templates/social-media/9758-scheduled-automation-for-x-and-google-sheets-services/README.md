# 📱 Scheduled automation for X and Google Sheets services

> ⚡ **87 views** · 📱 [Social Media & Email Marketing](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Twitter's API is paid now, which makes simple data pulls expensive. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/twitter) is a community node that scrapes [Twitter profiles](https://scrapernode.com/twitter/scrapers/profiles) and [posts](https://scrapernode.com/twitter/scrapers/posts) without needing API access.

## Description

Auto-like and repost latest tweets from accounts in Google Sheets
Who’s it for

Teams and solo creators who manage multiple X (Twitter) accounts they follow and want consistent engagement with minimal effort. Ideal for social managers, community leads, and campaign operators who need safe, repeatable automation.

What it does / How it works

On a schedule, the workflow reads a Google Sheet of screen names, fetches each account’s latest tweets, then likes and reposts them. A Limit node caps daily actions to respect rate limits and reduce risk. Every step includes Sticky notes: a yellow Overview (full description + safety notes) and white per-step notes (setup tips, filters, and expansion ideas).

How to set up

Add Credentials for X (Twitter) OAuth2 and Google Sheets (no hardcoded tokens).

Point the Google Sheets node to your sheet (header アカウントID, screen names without @).

Adjust the search query (e.g., -is:reply -is:retweet) and results per run.

Set the Schedule Trigger cadence and Limit (start with 1–3).

Test with a staging account, then enable scheduling.

Requirements

n8n 1.x+

X (Twitter) OAuth2 and Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials

A Google Sheet with column アカウントID

How to customize the workflow

Add a dry-run flag (Set → IF) to skip actions in testing.

Insert IF filters for NG words, language, or tweet age (created_at).

Add a Wait node between Like and Repost for cooldowns.

Append logs to another Google Sheet (status, URL, timestamp).

Security & quality: Use Credentials only, avoid personal IDs in nodes, and keep actions modest to respect API limits.

## 🔗 Nodes Used
