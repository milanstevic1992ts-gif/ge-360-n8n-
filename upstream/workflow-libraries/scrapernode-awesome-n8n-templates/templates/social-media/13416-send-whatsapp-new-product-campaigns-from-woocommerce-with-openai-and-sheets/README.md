## Description

## Who Is This For?
This workflow is perfect for e-commerce store owners using WooCommerce who want to automatically announce new products to their customers through personalized WhatsApp messages. It's ideal for businesses looking to increase product visibility and drive sales without manual outreach efforts.

## What This Workflow Does
This workflow automatically announces new WooCommerce products by extracting product images and converting HTML descriptions into concise, bullet-pointed features using OpenAI. It retrieves and formats customer data, including names, phone numbers, and addresses, and verifies which numbers are registered on WhatsApp via the Rapiwa API. Personalized messages containing product details, images, purchase links, and bullet-point features are sent to verified contacts, while all outreach is logged in Google Sheets, tracking which numbers were verified and messages successfully sent versus unverified or not sent.
## Key Features
* Triggers automatically for new WooCommerce products
* Extracts and processes product images and media
* Converts HTML descriptions into concise AI-powered bullet points
* Verifies WhatsApp numbers before sending
* Sends personalized WhatsApp messages with product info and images
* Updates Google Sheets with verification and delivery status

## Requirements
