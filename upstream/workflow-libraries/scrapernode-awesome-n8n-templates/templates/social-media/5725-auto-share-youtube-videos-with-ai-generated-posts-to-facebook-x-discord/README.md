> 💡 **Pro Tip** — YouTube's API quotas can be a bottleneck when you're pulling data at scale. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/youtube) is a community node with dedicated scrapers for [channels](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/channels), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/videos), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/comments) — no quota limits, just structured data.

## Description

## Auto-Share YouTube Videos with AI-Generated Posts to Facebook, X and Notify in Discord

This n8n template demonstrates how to use a LLM like DeepSeek to generate a post and share to Facebook page and X automatically whenever a new video is published to a YouTube channel.

### How it works
* We first define RSS with a polling schedule to pull YouTube videos from a specified channel
* Prompt AI agent to generate a post with proper url and hash tags based on the video metadata
* Then automatically create a new post in Facebook and X via their APIs
* Post a new message in Discord channel via Webhook

### How to use
* Simply setup a RSS polling trigger to automatically trigger the workflow

### Requirements
* Facebook API setup, see [step by step tutorials](https://developers.facebook.com/ads/blog/post/v2/2018/11/01/marketing-api-setup-101/#:~:text=Step%201:%20Create%20a%20Facebook,7:%20Generate%20an%20access%20token.)
* X v2 API setup, see [step by step tutorials](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/tutorials/step-by-step-guide-to-making-your-first-request-to-the-twitter-api-v2)
* Discord channel webhook, see [step by step tutorials](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)
