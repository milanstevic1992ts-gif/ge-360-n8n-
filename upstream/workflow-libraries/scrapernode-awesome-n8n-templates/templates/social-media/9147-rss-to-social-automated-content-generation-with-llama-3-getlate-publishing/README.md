> ⚡ **263 views** · 📱 [Social Media & Email Marketing](../)

## Description

🚀 **Automate your social media presence!** This workflow duo automatically curates content from your Wallabag RSS feeds, generates platform-specific posts using AI, and publishes them—complete with AI-generated images.

### **⚙️ Setup & Configuration**

**Required Credentials & Services:**
To run this workflow, you will need to set up the following credentials in n8n:
*   **Wallabag RSS Feeds:** This workflow uses Wallabag as your content curation service. Wallabag is the most cost-effective option—easy to self-host or use as a paid service. You'll need to generate access tokens for RSS feed access.
*   **Airtable API Key:** To create and update records in your "Content Store" database.
*   **LLM Provider API Key:** To power the social media content generation. The demo uses **Groq (llama-3.3-70b-versatile)**, but this can be replaced with any preferred LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
*   **GetLate API Key:** To authenticate and post to your social media platforms.
*   **Imgbb API Key:** To host the AI-generated images.
*   **An Image Generation Service API Key:** For creating images from prompts. The demo uses **Hugging Face (stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0)**, but this can be swapped for any other service (Fal.ai, Stability AI, etc.).

**Key Setup Requirement: Define Your Tagging Convention**
Before running this workflow, establish a consistent tagging system in Wallabag where each tag corresponds to a specific social media platform. For example:
* `#to-share-linkedin` for LinkedIn content
* `#to-share-bluesky` for Bluesky content
* `#to-share-instagram` for Instagram content

**Adding More Feeds & Platforms:**
* **New Feeds:** Simply duplicate the example sub-workflows and update the RSS feed URL and target platform information for each new tag/platform combination.
* **New Platforms:** To add support for additional social platforms, duplicate one of the existing platform sub-workflows (LinkedIn or Bluesky) and update the platform-specific parameters, prompts, and GetLate API settings for your new platform.

**Airtable Database Schema: "RSS Feed - Content Store"**
The workflow uses an Airtable base with the following fields to track content from ingestion to publication:
*   `id` (Primary Field):  Formula, for unique record ID (`RECORD_ID()`)
*   `audience_targeted`: Long text
*   `author`: Long text
*   `character_count`: Number
*   `content_markdown`: Long text
*   `cta_used`: Long text
*   `feed_id`: Single line text
*   `goal_applied`: Long text
*   `image_filename`: Singe line text
*   `image_id`: Single line text
*   `image_link`: URL
*   `image_prompt`: Long text
*   `is_posted`: Number, default is 0
*   `platform`: Single line text
*   `post_text`: Long text
*   `suggested_hashtags`: Long text
*   `title`: Long text
*   `tone_applied`: Long text
*   `article_url`: URL

**Customizable User Inputs:**
This workflow is built for flexibility. Key inputs you can customize include:
*   **Wallabag RSS Feed URL & Platform Tag:** The specific feed and platform-specific tag (e.g., `#to-share-linkedin`) to monitor in Workflow #1.
*   **Target Social Platform:** Defined per feed in the "Edit Field" node.
*   **Content Generation Schedule:** The frequency for auto-posting in the Schedule Trigger.
*   **Brand Voice & LLM Parameters:** The tone, style, and specific instructions for the AI in the "Set Custom SMCG Prompt" node.
*   **Platform-Specific Prompts:** The template used to generate posts for each social network (Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.).
*   **Posting Behavior & Image Generation:** Configured within the **SMCG (Social Media Content Generation) node**. This is where you set the posting mode (immediate vs. draft) and define a boolean for each platform to enable or disable AI-generated images for its posts.
