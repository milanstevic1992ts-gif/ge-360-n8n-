# 📱 Aws news monitoring & LinkedIn content automation with Claude 3 & Feishu

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

# AWS News Analysis and LinkedIn Automation Pipeline

Transform AWS industry news into engaging LinkedIn content with AI-powered analysis and automated approval workflows.

## Who's it for

This template is perfect for:
- **Cloud architects and DevOps engineers** who want to stay current with AWS developments
- **Content creators** looking to automate their AWS news coverage
- **Marketing teams** needing consistent, professional AWS content
- **Technical leaders** who want to share industry insights on LinkedIn
- **AWS consultants** building thought leadership through automated content

## How it works

This workflow creates a comprehensive AWS news analysis and content generation pipeline with two main flows:

### Flow 1: News Collection and Analysis
1. **Scheduled RSS Monitoring**: Automatically fetches latest AWS news from the official AWS RSS feed daily at 8 PM
2. **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses AWS Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet) to analyze each news item, extracting:
   - Professional summary
   - Key themes and keywords
   - Importance rating (Low/Medium/High)
   - Business impact assessment
3. **Structured Data Storage**: Saves analyzed news to Feishu Bitable with approval status tracking

### Flow 2: LinkedIn Content Generation
1. **Manual Approval Trigger**: Feishu automation sends approved news items to the webhook
2. **AI Content Creation**: AWS Bedrock generates professional LinkedIn posts with:
   - Attention-grabbing headlines
   - Technical insights from a Solutions Architect perspective
   - Business impact analysis
   - Call-to-action engagement
3. **Automated Publishing**: Posts directly to LinkedIn with relevant hashtags

- **n8n**: Self-hosted (free) or cloud subscription

## How to customize the workflow

### Content Customization
- **Modify AI prompts** in the AI Agent nodes to change tone, focus, or target audience
- **Adjust hashtags** in the LinkedIn posting node for different industries
- **Change scheduling** frequency by modifying the Schedule Trigger settings

### Integration Options
- **Replace LinkedIn** with Twitter/X, Facebook, or other social platforms
- **Add Slack notifications** for approved content before posting
- **Integrate with CRM** systems to track content performance
- **Add content calendar** integration for better planning

### Advanced Features

## Important Notes

### Service Limitations
- This template uses **community nodes** (Feishu Lite) and requires **self-hosted n8n**
- **Geo-restrictions** may apply to AWS Bedrock models in certain regions
- **Rate limits** may affect high-frequency posting - adjust scheduling accordingly
- **Content moderation** is recommended before automated posting
- **Cost considerations**: Each AI analysis costs approximately $0.01-0.05 USD per news item

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**AWS Bedrock Issues:**
- **Model not found**: Ensure Claude 3 Sonnet access is approved in your region
- **Access denied**: Verify IAM permissions include Bedrock service access
- **Rate limiting**: Implement retry logic or reduce analysis frequency

**Feishu Integration Issues:**
- **Authentication failed**: Check App Token and App Secret are correct
- **Table not found**: Verify Table ID matches your Bitable URL
- **Automation not triggering**: Ensure webhook URL is accessible and returns 200 status

**LinkedIn Posting Issues:**
- **OAuth2 errors**: Re-authenticate LinkedIn credentials
- **Posting failed**: Verify company page admin permissions
- **Rate limits**: LinkedIn has daily posting limits for company pages


### Security Best Practices
- **Never hardcode credentials** in workflow nodes
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **Regularly rotate API keys** and access tokens
- **Monitor API usage** to prevent unexpected charges
- **Implement error handling** for failed API calls
