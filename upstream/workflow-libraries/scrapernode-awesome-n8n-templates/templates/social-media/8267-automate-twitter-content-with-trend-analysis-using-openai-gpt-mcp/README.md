> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Twitter's API is paid now, which makes simple data pulls expensive. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/twitter) is a community node that scrapes [Twitter profiles](https://scrapernode.com/twitter/scrapers/profiles) and [posts](https://scrapernode.com/twitter/scrapers/posts) without needing API access.

## Description

## How it works

This template creates a fully automated Twitter content system that discovers trending topics, analyzes why they're trending using AI, and posts intelligent commentary about them.

The workflow uses **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** with the **twitter154 MCP server** from [MCPHub](https://mcphub.com/mcp-servers/aigeon-ai/twitter154) to connect with Twitter APIs and leverages **OpenAI GPT models** to generate brand-safe, engaging content about current trends.

**Key Features:**
- 🔍 **Smart Trend Discovery**: Automatically finds US trending topics with engagement scoring
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses GPT to explain "why it's trending" in 30-60 words  
- 📊 **Duplicate Prevention**: MySQL database tracks posted trends with 3-day cooldowns
- 🛡️ **Brand Safety**: Filters out NSFW content and low-quality hashtags
- ⚡ **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to respect API limits
- 🐦 **Powered by twitter154**: Uses the robust "Old Bird" MCP server for comprehensive Twitter data access
