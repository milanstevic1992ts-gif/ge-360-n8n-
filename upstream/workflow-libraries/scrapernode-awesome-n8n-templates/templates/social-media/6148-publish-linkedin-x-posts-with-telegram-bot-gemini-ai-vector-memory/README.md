> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*

# Overview

This is a Telegram Bot capable of receiving information from the user in the form of text messages, voice messages, images or documents (e.g., presentations, PDFs, HTML pages), and publishing posts to the user's social platforms.

The bot always sends the user a draft of the post for verification before publishing it.

The bot saves relevant information to its long-term memory (vector store), so you don't need to repeat it in every interaction (e.g., who you are, your company, product, etc.).

This template supports creating posts in LinkedIn and X.
