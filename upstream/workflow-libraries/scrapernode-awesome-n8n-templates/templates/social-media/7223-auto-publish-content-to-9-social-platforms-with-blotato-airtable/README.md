> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

## Description

*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*

**How it works**
• Publishes content to 9 social platforms (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, Threads, Twitter/X, Bluesky, Pinterest) from a single Airtable base
• Automatically uploads media to Blotato, handles platform-specific requirements (YouTube titles, Pinterest boards), and tracks success/failure for each post
• Includes smart features like GPT-powered YouTube title optimization, Pinterest Board ID finder tool, and random delays to avoid rate limits

**Set up steps**  
• Takes ~20–35 minutes to configure all 9 platforms (or less if you only need specific ones)
• Requires Airtable personal access token, Blotato API key, and connecting your social accounts in Blotato dashboard
• Workflow includes comprehensive sticky notes with step-by-step Airtable base setup, credential configuration, platform ID locations, and quick debugging links for each social network

**Pro tip**: The workflow is modular - you can disable any platforms you don't use by deactivating their respective nodes, making it flexible for any social media strategy from single-platform to full omnichannel publishing.
