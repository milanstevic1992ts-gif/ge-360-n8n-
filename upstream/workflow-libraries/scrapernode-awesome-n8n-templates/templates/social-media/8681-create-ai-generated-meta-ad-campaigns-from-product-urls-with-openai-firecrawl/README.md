> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

This template takes a **product URL** and produces **publish-ready Meta ads** without the busywork. Your client fills a clean form; the workflow scrapes product data, writes a creative brief, generates ad-set variations, produces 1:1 images with OpenAI, and builds Campaign → Ad Set(s) → Ad(s) in **PAUSED** for review.

**Perfect for:** agencies, performance marketers, founders who need repeatable creative and less manual setup.

**Highlights**

* Form-based intake (client-friendly)
* Schema-clean product extraction (no made-up facts)
* Vision cues for on-brand visuals
* Platform-safe 1:1 images and copy lengths
* Auto placements by default (or customize)
* Creates assets in **PAUSED** so you stay in control

---

## What’s inside

* **Form Trigger**: “AI Ad Creation”
* **Firecrawl**: scrape product content + images
* **OpenAI (LLM + Vision)**: clean JSON + aesthetic/emotion cues
* **Creative Brief Builder**: merges product facts with tone/goals
* **Campaign JSON Generator**: campaign + ad\_sets as strict schema
* **OpenAI Images**: 1:1 creatives (1024×1024 by default)
* **Meta Graph API**: upload assets, create creatives, campaign, ad sets, and ads (**PAUSED**)
* **Split / Batch / Wait / If / Set / Merge**: stable, scalable processing

---

## How it works

```
Form → Firecrawl scrape → Product JSON (LLM) → Vision style cues → Creative brief
→ Campaign JSON (LLM) → Split into ad sets → For each ad set:
→ Generate image → Upload to Meta → Create Creative → Create Campaign → Create Ad Set → Create Ad (PAUSED)
```

## Sticky notes (mandatory)

&gt; **Credentials**
&gt;
&gt; * Use **OpenAI**, **Facebook Graph API**, and **Firecrawl** credentials in n8n.
&gt; * ⚠️ **No hardcoded keys** anywhere (HTTP node or otherwise).

&gt; **Form Testing**
&gt;
&gt; * Use a **real product URL** with at least one image.
&gt; * Start with **1–2** variations; scale after review.
&gt; * If scraping fails, verify Firecrawl key and the site’s policies.

&gt; **Meta Upload**
&gt;
&gt; * Set `ad_account_id`, `facebook_page_id`, `pixel_id`, `website_link`.
&gt; * If uploads fail, check account permissions and app scopes.

&gt; **OpenAI Images**
&gt;
&gt; * Default: **1:1, 1024×1024**.
&gt; * You can change size in the Images node (keep FB/IG safe zones).
&gt; * Prompts should avoid policy-sensitive claims.

&gt; **Safety & Review**
&gt;
&gt; * Everything is created **PAUSED**.
&gt; * Review copy, claims, and targeting for compliance.
&gt; * Enable after quality checks.

---

## Security & compliance

* Secrets live in **n8n Credentials** or environment variables—never in nodes.
* Follow **Meta ad policies** (no restricted claims, no before/after, etc.).
* Product facts only; unknown fields remain `null`/empty arrays.

---

## Performance tips

* Start with **auto placements**; test Feed/Reels later if needed.
* Keep primary text **125–200 chars**; headline short (testimonial-style in quotes).
* Use the best product image as **reference**.
* Scale carefully: tune **Batch** and **Wait** for your throughput.

## FAQ

**Does it publish automatically?**
No. Ads are created **PAUSED** for review.

**Instagram-only campaigns?**
Yes. Set placements to IG (or keep auto and let Meta optimize).

**Thin product pages?**
Extractor returns `null` for missing fields; the brief adapts without inventing data.

**Bring my own audiences?**
Swap the generated audience block for your saved audiences or static lists.

**Change image model/size?**
Yes—edit the OpenAI Images node (model/size). Keep 1:1 for FB/IG.
