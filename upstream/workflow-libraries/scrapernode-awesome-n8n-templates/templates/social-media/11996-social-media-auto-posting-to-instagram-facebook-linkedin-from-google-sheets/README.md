> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

## 📌 Workflow Overview

This workflow enables **multi-platform social media posting** using **Google Sheets as the control center**.

Whenever a new row is added to the sheet, the workflow automatically posts the content to **Instagram, Facebook, and/or LinkedIn** based on platform flags, then updates the post status to prevent duplicates.

### Supported Platforms
- Instagram (Business)
- Facebook Pages
- LinkedIn Pages

---

## 🧠 Key Concept

*Google Sheets acts as a lightweight CMS and automation trigger.*

Each row represents **one post**, and simple TRUE/FALSE columns decide where that post should be published.

---

## 📄 Required Google Sheets Columns

The content sheet must include the following columns:

- **Content** – Text to publish  
- **Instagram** – TRUE / FALSE  
- **Facebook** – TRUE / FALSE  
- **LinkedIn** – TRUE / FALSE  
- **Status** – Updated after posting  
- **Row Number** – Used for precise updates  

---

## ⚙️ How This Workflow Works

### 1️⃣ Trigger: New Content Added
- The workflow starts when a **new row is added** to Google Sheets.
- This allows near real-time publishing without manual execution.

---

### 2️⃣ Configuration Setup
- Platform-specific values like:
  - Instagram Business Account ID
  - Facebook Page ID  
- Are defined once in a **configuration node** for easy reuse and maintenance.

---

### 3️⃣ Platform Routing Logic
- IF nodes check each platform column:
  - Instagram = TRUE → post to Instagram
  - Facebook = TRUE → post to Facebook
  - LinkedIn = TRUE → post to LinkedIn
- One row can trigger posting to **multiple platforms**.

---

### 4️⃣ Platform Posting
- Posts are published using:
  - Facebook Graph API (Instagram + Facebook)
  - LinkedIn API (LinkedIn Pages)
- The **Content** column is used directly as the post body.

---

### 5️⃣ Status Update (Per Platform)
- After posting:
  - The workflow updates the same row using **Row Number**
  - Marks the post as completed for that platform
- This prevents duplicate or accidental re-posts.

---

## 🔄 Current Capabilities

- Multi-platform posting from one sheet  
- Platform-specific routing logic  
- Real-time execution on new content  
- Safe status updates using row matching  

---

## 🚀 Designed for Easy Expansion

This workflow is intentionally modular and can be extended with:

- Scheduled posting (date/time columns)
- Image & media handling
- AI-generated captions
- Hashtag optimization
- Engagement analytics
- Retry & error handling logic

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Use **TRUE / FALSE** consistently in platform columns  
- Keep Google Sheets as the single source of truth  
- Add validation or approval columns if used by teams  

---

## 📦 Ideal Use Cases

- Social media managers  
- Marketing teams  
- Founders & creators  
- Agencies handling multiple platforms  

---

*This workflow provides a scalable foundation for social media automation while remaining simple, transparent, and easy to maintain.*
