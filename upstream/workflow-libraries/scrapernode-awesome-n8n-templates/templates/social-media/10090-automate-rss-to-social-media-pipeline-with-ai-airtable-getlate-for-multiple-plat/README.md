> ⚡ **246 views** · 📱 [Social Media & Email Marketing](../)

## Description

## Overview

Automates your complete social media content pipeline: sources articles from Wallabag RSS, generates platform-specific posts with AI, creates contextual images, and publishes via GetLate API. Built with 63 nodes across two workflows to handle LinkedIn, Instagram, and Bluesky—with easy expansion to more platforms.

**Ideal for**: Content marketers, solo creators, agencies, and community managers maintaining a consistent multi-platform presence with minimal manual effort.

## How It Works

**Two-Workflow Architecture:**


1. **Content Aggregation Workflow**
   * Monitors Wallabag RSS feeds for tagged articles (#to-share-linkedin, #to-share-instagram, etc.)
   * Extracts and converts content from HTML to Markdown
   * Stores structured data in Airtable with platform assignment
2. **AI Generation & Publishing Workflow**
   * Scheduled trigger queries Airtable for unpublished content
   * Routes to platform-specific sub-workflows (LinkedIn, Instagram, Bluesky)
   * LLM generates optimized post text and image prompts based on custom brand parameters
   * Optionally generates AI images and hosts them on Imgbb CDN
   * Publishes via GetLate API (immediate or draft mode)
   * Updates Airtable with publication status and metadata

**Key Features:**

* Tag-based content routing using Wallabag's native system
* Swappable AI providers (Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic)
* Platform-specific optimization (tone, length, hashtags, CTAs)
* Modular design—duplicate sub-workflows to add new platforms in \~30 minutes
* Centralized Airtable tracking with 17 data points per post

## Set Up Steps

**Setup time**: \~45-60 minutes for initial configuration


1. **Create accounts and get API keys** (\~15 min)
   * Wallabag (with RSS feeds enabled)
   * GetLate (social media publishing)
   * Airtable (create base with provided schema—see sticky notes)
   * LLM provider (Groq, OpenAI, or Anthropic)
   * Image service (Hugging Face, [Fal.ai](http://Fal.ai), or Stability AI)
   * Imgbb (image hosting)
2. **Configure n8n credentials** (\~10 min)
   * Add all API keys in n8n's credential manager
   * Detailed credential setup instructions in workflow sticky notes
3. **Set up Airtable database** (\~10 min)
   * Create "RSS Feed - Content Store" base
   * Add 19 required fields (schema provided in workflow sticky notes)
   * Get Airtable base ID and API key
4. **Customize brand prompts** (\~15 min)

   * Choose immediate publish vs. draft mode
   * Adjust schedule trigger frequency
6. **Test and deploy**
   * Tag test articles in Wallabag
   * Monitor the first few executions in draft mode
   * Activate workflows when satisfied with the output

**Important**: This is a proof-of-concept template. Test thoroughly with draft mode before production use. Detailed setup instructions, troubleshooting tips, and customization guidance are in the workflow's sticky notes.
