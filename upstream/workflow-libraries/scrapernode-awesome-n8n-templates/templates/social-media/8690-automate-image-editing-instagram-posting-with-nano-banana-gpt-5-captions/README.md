## Description

##  **Auto-Edit Google Drive Images with Nano Banana + Social Auto-Post**

Drop an image into Google Drive and let this workflow handle the rest: it auto-cleans and enhances the image with Google’s Nano Banana (via Wavespeed API), generates a catchy caption with GPT-5, and publishes directly to your connected social accounts using Postiz.
