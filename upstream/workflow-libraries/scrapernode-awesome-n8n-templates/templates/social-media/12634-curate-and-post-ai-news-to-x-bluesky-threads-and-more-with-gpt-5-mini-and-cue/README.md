> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

## Description

# Curate & post AI news to X, Bluesky, Threads & more via GPT-5 mini & Cue

This n8n template automatically curates AI news from RSS feeds and generates platform-tailored social media posts using GPT-5 mini. Posts are saved as drafts in Cue for review before publishing to X, Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon, and Facebook.

Use cases include:
* Daily automated AI/tech news curation
* Multi-platform social media content creation
* Building thought leadership with consistent posting
* Staying on top of industry news without manual effort

## Who is this for?

This workflow is ideal for:
* Tech content creators who want to share AI news across multiple platforms
* Social media managers handling multiple accounts
* Anyone building an audience around AI/tech topics
* Teams who want consistent daily content without manual curation

## What problem does this workflow solve?

Manually curating news, writing platform-specific posts, and publishing across 5 different social networks is time-consuming. This workflow automates the entire process:
* **Curation** - Pulls from 4 trusted AI/tech RSS feeds daily
* **Deduplication** - Tracks posted articles in Google Sheets so you never share the same story twice
* **Content creation** - GPT-5 mini writes posts tailored to each platform's style and character limits
* **Review workflow** - Creates drafts in Cue so you can review before publishing

## How it works

1. **Schedule Trigger** - Runs daily at 9am (configurable)
2. **RSS Feeds** - Fetches articles from TechCrunch AI, Ars Technica AI, The Verge AI, and MIT Tech Review
3. **Filter & Merge** - Combines all feeds and filters to articles from the last 7 days
4. **Deduplication** - Compares against Google Sheets to find unposted articles
5. **Random Selection** - Picks one random article from available stories
6. **AI Generation** - GPT-5 mini generates 5 platform-specific posts with appropriate tone and length
7. **Save to Cue** - Creates a draft post with all 5 platform variations
8. **Log to Sheet** - Records the article URL to prevent future duplicates

## Setup

### Requirements
* [Cue account](https://oncue.so) with connected social accounts
* OpenAI API key
* Google account for Sheets

### Step 1: Install the Cue community node
1. Go to **Settings** → **Community Nodes**
2. Click **Install**
3. Enter `@cuehq/n8n-nodes-cue`

### Step 2: Create tracking spreadsheet
1. Create a new Google Sheet named "AI News Tracker"
2. Add these column headers in row 1:
   * `article_url`
   * `title`
   * `source`
   * `processed_at`

### Step 3: Configure credentials
1. **Google Sheets** - Add OAuth2 credentials and connect to the "Get Recent Posts" node
2. **OpenAI** - Add your API key and connect to the "GPT-5 mini" node
3. **Cue** - Add your API key from [Cue Settings](https://app.oncue.so/settings/api)

### Step 4: Configure the Cue node
1. Open the **Create Draft in Cue** node
2. Select your **Profile**
3. For each platform slot, select your social account:
   * Slot 1 → X/Twitter
   * Slot 2 → Bluesky
   * Slot 3 → Threads
   * Slot 4 → Mastodon
   * Slot 5 → Facebook

Don't have all 5 platforms? Simply delete the unused slots.

### Step 5: Publish
Save and click **Publish** to activate the workflow.

## Customizing this workflow

### Change the schedule
Edit the **Daily 9am Trigger** node to run at a different time or frequency.

### Use different RSS feeds
Replace the feed URLs with sources relevant to your niche. The workflow handles any standard RSS feed. Keep 3-6 feeds for best results.

### Auto-publish instead of drafts
To publish immediately instead of creating drafts, enable **Publish Immediately** in the Cue node settings.

### Adjust the AI tone
Modify the system prompt in the **Write Social Posts** node to match your brand voice or adjust platform-specific guidelines.

## Good to know

* **Cost** - Each run uses one OpenAI API call. With GPT-5 mini, this costs approximately $0.01-0.02 per execution.
* **Draft review** - Posts are created as drafts in Cue, giving you a chance to review and edit before publishing.
* **Deduplication** - The Google Sheet tracks all posted URLs, so the same article is never shared twice.
