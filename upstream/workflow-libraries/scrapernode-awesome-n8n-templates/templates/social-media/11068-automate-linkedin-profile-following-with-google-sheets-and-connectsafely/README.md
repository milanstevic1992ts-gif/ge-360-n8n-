# 📱 Automate LinkedIn Profile Following with Google Sheets and ConnectSafely

> ⚡ **83 views** · 📱 [Social Media & Email Marketing](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Setup steps

### Step 1: Install ConnectSafely.ai n8n Package

Install the official ConnectSafely.ai community node:

```bash
Package name: n8n-nodes-connectsafely.ai
```

**Installation Methods:**

**Option A: Via n8n Interface**
1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Community Nodes**
2. Search for `n8n-nodes-connectsafely.ai`
3. Click **Install**

**Option B: Via npm**
```bash
npm install n8n-nodes-connectsafely.ai
```

**Important**: A complete n8n restart is required after installation for the nodes to appear.


### Step 2: Prepare Your Google Sheet

Structure your Google Sheet with the following columns:

| Column Name | Description | Required |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| `LinkedIn Url` | LinkedIn profile URL or ID | Yes |
| `First Name` | Contact's first name | Optional |
| `Tagline` | Contact's headline/title | Optional |
| `Status` | Processing status (pending/done) | Yes |
| `row_number` | Auto-generated row identifier | Yes |

**Sample Data Format:**
```
LinkedIn Url: https://www.linkedin.com/in/username
Status: pending
```

### Step 3: Configure Google Sheets Integration

1. Add **Google Sheets** node (Get Rows operation)
2. Authenticate with Google OAuth:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - OAuth Token
3. Select your document and sheet
4. Configure to pull all rows with pending status


### Step 4: Configure ConnectSafely.ai Credentials

#### Obtain API Credentials

1. Log into [ConnectSafely.ai Dashboard](https://connectsafely.ai/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy your **Account ID** from the **Accounts** section

#### Configure n8n Node

1. Add **ConnectSafely LinkedIn** node
2. Select **Follow a User** operation
3. Add credentials:
   - **API Key**: Paste your ConnectSafely API key
   - **Account ID**: Your LinkedIn account ID from dashboard
4. Map **Profile ID** field:
   - Use expression: `{{ $json['LinkedIn Url'] }}`
   - This dynamically pulls the profile URL from each row


### Step 5: Configure Status Tracking

Add a second **Google Sheets** node for status updates:

1. Select **Update Row** operation
2. Choose the same Google Sheet
3. Configure column mapping:
   - **Matching Column**: `row_number`
   - **Update Field**: `Status` → `done`
4. Map row_number expression: `{{ $('Get row(s) in sheet').item.json.row_number }}`

This ensures accurate tracking of processed profiles and enables workflow resumption.

- **Solution**: Verify API key has proper permissions in dashboard

**Issue**: Profile ID format errors
