> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Heads up — if this workflow's Instagram scraping breaks (it happens whenever Meta updates their frontend), [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/instagram) is a community node that handles [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/profiles), [posts](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/posts), [reels](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/reels), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/comments) without any HTML parsing.

## Description

## How It Works
This workflow automates cross-platform content distribution from Instagram to YouTube with intelligent AI enhancement. Designed for content creators, social media managers, and digital marketers who need to maximize their content reach across platforms efficiently. The template solves the challenge of manual video repurposing by automating the entire process from content retrieval to optimized publishing. It retrieves Instagram videos on schedule, generates engaging metadata using dual AI models (Anthropic Claude for creative titles/descriptions), uploads to YouTube, logs performance metrics to Google Sheets, and sends WhatsApp notifications upon completion. The workflow intelligently routes tasks between AI providers: Claude's language capabilities create compelling and platform-optimized content. This dual-model approach delivers superior results compared to single-AI solutions, combining creativity with precision for maximum engagement.
