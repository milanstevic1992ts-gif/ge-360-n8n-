> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

# This workflow automates your LinkedIn content curation and posting using AI.

Every week, it pulls the latest marketing insights from an RSS feed (like HubSpot’s), analyzes them, and turns the best article into a crisp, human-style LinkedIn post — complete with **branded visuals and headline text** using the **Templated API**.

You can fully customize it for your own brand’s voice, niche, and platform.

## ⚙️ What It Does

📰 **Fetches articles** from any RSS feed you choose  

🧩 **Uses AI (Gemini)** to:
- Pick the most relevant article for your target audience  
- Rewrite it into a short, save-worthy post (&lt;200 words)  
- Optimize tone, clarity, and structure for readability  

🖼️ **Uses Templated API** to:
- Generate branded visuals with your own layout or assets  
- Auto-inject headline text into image templates  
- Maintain consistent post design across your feed  

🤖 **Auto-posts to LinkedIn** (only if AI confidence ≥7/10)
