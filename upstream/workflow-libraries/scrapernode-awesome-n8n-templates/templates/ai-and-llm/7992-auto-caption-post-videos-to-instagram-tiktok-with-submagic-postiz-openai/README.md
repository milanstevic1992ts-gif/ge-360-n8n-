> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

## Description

# 🎥 Auto-Caption & Autopost Videos to Instagram & TikTok

## Description
Automate your short-form content pipeline! This workflow takes any video uploaded to a specific Google Drive folder, generates engaging captions with Submagic, and then auto-posts the finished video (with AI-generated captions) directly to Instagram or TikTok via Postiz. Captions are further refined with OpenAI for brand-ready social text. Finally, each published video is logged into a Google Sheet for tracking.
