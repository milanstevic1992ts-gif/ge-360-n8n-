> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

**Who this is for**

This workflow is for **freelancers**, **job seekers**, or **service providers** who want to **automatically apply to businesses** by scraping their website information, extracting contact details, and sending **personalized job application emails** with AI-powered content — all from one form submission.

**What this workflow does**

This workflow starts every time someone submits the **Job Applier Form**. It then:
* **Scrapes the target business website** to gather company information and contact details.
* **Converts HTML content** to readable markdown format for better AI processing.
* **Extracts email addresses** and creates a company summary using **GPT-5 AI**.
* **Validates email addresses** to ensure they contain proper formatting (@ symbol check).
* **Accesses your experience data** from a connected **Google Sheet** with your skills and portfolio.
* **Generates personalized application emails** (subject + body) using **GPT-5** based on the job position and company info.
* **Sends the application email** automatically via **Gmail** with your name as sender.
* **Provides confirmation** through a completion form showing the AI's response.

**Setup**

To set this workflow up:
1. **Form Trigger** – Customize the job application form fields (Target Business Website, Applying As dropdown with positions like Video Editor, SEO Expert, etc.).
2. **OpenAI GPT-5** – Add your OpenAI API credentials for both AI models used in the workflow.
3. **Google Sheets** – Connect your sheet containing your working experience data, skills, and portfolio information.
4. **Gmail Account** – Link your Gmail account for sending application emails automatically.
5. **Experience Data** – Update the Google Sheet with your relevant skills, experience, and achievements for each job type.
6. **Sender Name** – Modify the sender name in Gmail settings (currently set to "Jamal Mia").

**How to customize this workflow to your needs**
* Add **more job positions** to the dropdown menu (currently includes Video Editor, SEO Expert, Full-Stack Developer, Social Media Manager).
* Modify the **AI prompt** to reflect your unique value proposition and application style.
* Enhance **email validation** with additional checks like domain verification or email format patterns.
