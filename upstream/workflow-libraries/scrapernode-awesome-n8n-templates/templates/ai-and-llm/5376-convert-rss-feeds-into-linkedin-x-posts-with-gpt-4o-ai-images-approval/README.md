# ✨ Convert RSS feeds into LinkedIn & X posts with GPT-4o & AI images & approval

> ⚡ **86 views** · ✨ [AI & LLMs](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## 😩 The Problem

You've invested hours writing the perfect blog post. But the work isn't over. Now you have to manually copy, paste, and rewrite that content for different social platforms. You need a professional tone for LinkedIn, something short and snappy for X, and you have to find or create visuals for both. This tedious, repetitive task drains your creative energy and leads to your social media presence becoming stale or inconsistent.

## ✨ The Solution

This workflow acts as your automated content marketing assistant, elegantly solving the problem. Here’s the magic in action:

1. **New Blog Post Detected:** The workflow constantly watches a specific RSS feed (e.g., your company blog).
2. **AI Content Generation:** When a new post appears, the AI (powered by **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**) reads the article, performs a quick web search for context (via SerpAPI), and drafts optimized posts for LinkedIn and X. It also generates a brand-new image based on the article’s topic.
3. **Secure Image Hosting:** The generated image is uploaded to your Imgbb account for a shareable link.
4. **Approval Workflow:** A notification is sent directly to your email inbox with the generated text and image for review.
5. **One-Click Go-Live:** If approved, the workflow automatically publishes the content to the correct social media profiles.
