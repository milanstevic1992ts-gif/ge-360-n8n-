## Description

# 🧰 Instagram Carousel Scheduler

A tool to **automatically publish Instagram carousels** using a `Post Description`, `Instructions`, and the **number of images** you want to post — all directly from a Google Sheet.
At the end of each post, the next row is marked as `Pending`, allowing **fully automated posting**, so you can prepare **months of content in advance**.
