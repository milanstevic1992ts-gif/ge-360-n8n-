## Description

This n8n template creates an **intelligent expense tracking system** 🤖 that processes text, voice, and receipt images through Telegram. The assistant automatically **categorizes expenses**, **handles currency conversions** 🌍, and **maintains financial records** in Google Sheets while **providing smart spending insights** 💡.

### Use Cases:

-   🗣️ Personal expense tracking via Telegram chat
-   🧾 Receipt scanning and data extraction
-   💱 Multi-currency expense management
-   📂 Automated financial categorization

### How it works:

1.  **Multi-Input Processing**: Telegram trigger captures text messages, voice notes, and receipt images.
2.  **Content Analysis**: A Switch node routes different input types (text, audio, images) to appropriate processors.
3.  **Voice Processing**: ElevenLabs converts voice messages to text for expense extraction.
4.  **Receipt OCR**: Google Gemini analyzes receipt images to extract amounts and descriptions.
5.  **Expense Classification**: An LLM determines if the input is an expense or a general query.
6.  **Expense Parsing**: For multiple expenses, the AI splits and normalizes each item.
7.  **Currency Conversion**: An exchange rate API converts foreign currencies to USD.
8.  **Smart Categorization**: The AI agent assigns expenses to predefined categories with emojis.
9.  **Data Storage**: Google Sheets stores all expense records with automatic totals.
