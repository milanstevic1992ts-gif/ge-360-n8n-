> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

**Template Description:**
&gt; Never run out of high-quality LinkedIn content again. This workflow is a complete content factory that takes a simple topic from a Google Sheet, uses AI to research a trending angle, writes a full post, generates a unique and **on-brand** image, and publishes it directly to your LinkedIn profile.

This template is designed for brands and creators who want to maintain a consistent, high-quality social media presence with minimal effort. The core feature is its ability to generate visuals that adhere to a specific, customizable brand style guide.

---

**🚀 What does this workflow do?**

*   Pulls content ideas from a **Google Sheet** acting as your content calendar.
*   Uses an **AI Researcher (OpenAI + SerpAPI)** to find the most recent and engaging news or trends related to your topic.
*   Employs an **AI Writer** to draft a complete, professional LinkedIn post with a catchy title, engaging text, and relevant hashtags.
*   Generates a **unique, on-brand image** for every post using Replicate, based on a customizable style guide (colors, composition, mood) defined within the workflow.
*   **Publishes the post with its image** directly to your LinkedIn profile.
*   **Updates the status** in your Google Sheet to "done" to avoid duplicate posts.

**🎯 Who is this for?**

*   **Marketing Teams:** Automate your content calendar and ensure brand consistency across all visuals.
*   **Social Media Managers:** Save hours of research, writing, and design work.
*   **Solopreneurs & Founders:** Maintain an active, professional LinkedIn presence without a dedicated content team.
*   **Content Creators:** Scale your content production and focus on strategy instead of execution.

**✨ Benefits**

*   **End-to-End Automation:** From a single keyword to a published post, the entire process is automated.
*   **Brand Consistency:** The AI image generator follows a strict, customizable style guide, ensuring all your visuals feel like they belong to your brand.
*   **Always Relevant Content:** The AI research step ensures your posts are based on current trends and news, increasing engagement.
*   **Massive Time Savings:** Automates research, copywriting, and graphic design in one seamless flow.
*   **Content Calendar Integration:** Easily manage your content pipeline using a simple Google Sheet.

**⚙️ How it Works**

1.  **Get Topic:** The workflow fetches the next "Pending" topic from your Google Sheet.
2.  **AI Research:** An AI Agent uses SerpAPI to research the topic and identify a viral angle.
3.  **AI Writing:** A second AI Agent takes the research and writes the full LinkedIn post.
4.  **Generate Image Prompt:** A `Code` node constructs a detailed prompt, merging the post's content with your defined brand style guide.
5.  **Generate Image:** The prompt is sent to Replicate. The workflow waits and checks periodically until the image is ready.
6.  **Publish:** The generated text and image are published to your LinkedIn account.
7.  **Update Status:** The workflow archives the image to Google Drive and updates the topic's status in your Google Sheet to "done".
