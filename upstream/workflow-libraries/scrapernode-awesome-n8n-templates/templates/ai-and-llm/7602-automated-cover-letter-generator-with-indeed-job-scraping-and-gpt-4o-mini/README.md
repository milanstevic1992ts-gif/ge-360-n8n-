> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Job boards are notoriously hard to scrape — CAPTCHAs, rate limits, constantly changing layouts. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) has maintained scrapers for [Indeed jobs](https://scrapernode.com/indeed/scrapers/jobs), [Glassdoor reviews](https://scrapernode.com/glassdoor/scrapers/reviews), and [Glassdoor jobs](https://scrapernode.com/glassdoor/scrapers/jobs) that handle all of that for you.

## Description

This workflow automates the process of writing tailored **cover letters** for job applications. It:  
1. Uses **Apify’s Indeed Scraper** to pull live job postings based on your chosen search term.  
2. Sends the job description along with your resume into **OpenAI**, which writes an optimized cover letter — one paragraph plus bullet points — only using details from your resume.  

Perfect for quickly generating professional, customized cover letters for each role you want to apply to.
