# 🎣 🎯 Precision prospecting: Automate LinkedIn lead gen with Bright Data

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

🎯 **Precision Prospecting: Automate LinkedIn Lead Gen with n8n & Bright Data**

📝 **Overview**
This workflow turns n8n into an AI-powered prospector, automatically searching Google for LinkedIn profiles, scraping profile data via [Bright Data](https://get.brightdata.com/ar8wlq0xkpv5), and summarizing key details. Ideal for sales and recruitment teams seeking targeted lead lists without manual research.

🔑 **Key Features**

* **AI Chat Trigger**: Start prospecting via conversational prompts.
* **Contextual Memory**: Retains the last 20 messages for coherent dialogue.
* **Automated Google Search**: Generates site-restricted queries and fetches the top result.
* **Bright Data Scraping**: Synchronously scrapes LinkedIn profile details by URL.
* **Intelligent Filtering**: Extracts only valid LinkedIn profile links.
* **Limit Control**: Returns a single, most relevant profile per request.
* **LLM Summary**: Uses GPT-4o-mini to interpret and present scraped data.

🚀 **How It Works (Step-by-Step)**

1. **Prerequisites**:

   * n8n ≥ v1.0 with community nodes: install `n8n-nodes-brightdata` (not verified community node).
   * API credentials: OpenAI, Bright Data (web unlocker zone “web\_unlocker1”).
   * Webhook endpoint for chat trigger.

2. **Node Configuration**:

   * **When chat message received** (`chatTrigger`): Fires on user prompt.
   * **Simple Memory1** (`memoryBufferWindow`): Stores the last 20 chat messages.
   * **AI Prospector Agent** (`agent`): Orchestrates search logic.
   * **Get 1 Google Result** (`brightData`): Performs a Google search with `site:linkedin.com/in`.
   * **Get Links from Body** (`html`): Extracts all `<a>` hrefs from the search result page.
   * **Extract Links** (`splitOut`): Splits out individual link entries.
   * **Filter only LinkedIn Profiles** (`filter`): Ensures the URL contains “linkedin.com/” and starts with “https\://”.
   * **Limit** (`limit`): Restricts output to the first valid profile URL.
   * **Search LinkedIn URI** (`toolWorkflow`): Passes the URL to a secondary workflow to fetch the first link.
   * **Get LinkedIn Profile Data** (`brightDataTool`): Scrapes the profile JSON.
   * **OpenAI Chat Model** (`lmChatOpenAi`): Summarizes and formats the scraped data.

3. **Workflow Logic**:

   * User asks for a person by company & name, company & position, or LinkedIn URL.
   * Agent builds a Google query (e.g., `site:linkedin.com/in bright data cmo`) and calls “Get 1 Google Result.”
   * Extracted links are filtered and limited to the top valid profile.
   * If user provided a direct LinkedIn URL, Agent skips search and scrapes immediately.
   * Scraped profile JSON is passed to GPT-4o-mini to generate a concise summary.

4. **Testing & Optimization**:

   * Trigger via **Execute Workflow** for dry runs.
   * Inspect intermediate node outputs in n8n’s Execution panel.
   * Adjust `maxIterations` or memory window length for performance.
   * Tune Bright Data zone or country settings to optimize scraping speed.

5. **Deployment & Monitoring**:

   * Activate the workflow and expose its webhook URL.
   * Use n8n’s built-in Alerts or external monitoring (e.g., Slack notifications) on failures.
   * Rotate credentials via n8n’s Credential Vault when needed.
   * Version-control workflow via duplicates or Git-backed n8n instances.

✅ **Pre-requisites**

* **OpenAI Account**: API key for GPT-4o-mini.
* **Bright Data Account**: Zone “web\_unlocker1” and dataset `gd_l1viktl72bvl7bjuj0`.
* **n8n Version**: v1.0+ with community nodes installed.
* **Permissions**: Webhook access, Credential Vault read/write.

👤 **Who Is This For?**

* Sales teams automating outbound LinkedIn prospecting.
* Recruiters sourcing candidates without manual scraping.
* Marketing ops looking to enrich CRM with accurate profile data.

📈 **Benefits & Use Cases**

* **Efficiency**: Reduces hours of manual search and data entry to seconds.
* **Accuracy**: Filters out non-LinkedIn links and ensures high-quality results.
* **Scalability**: Handle multiple prospect requests concurrently via chat or API.
* **Integration**: Easily hook into CRMs or email sequencers downstream.
