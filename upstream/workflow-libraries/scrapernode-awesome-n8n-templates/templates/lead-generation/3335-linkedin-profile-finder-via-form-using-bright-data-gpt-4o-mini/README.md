> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

This n8n workflow template automates the process of finding LinkedIn profiles for a person based on their name, and company. It scrapes Google search results via [Bright Data](https://get.brightdata.com/ar8wlq0xkpv5), parses the results with GPT-4o-mini, and delivers a personalized follow-up email with insights and suggested outreach steps.

🚀 What It Does
- Accepts a user-submitted form with a person’s full name, and company.
- Performs a Google search using Bright Data to find LinkedIn profiles and company data.
- Uses GPT-4o-mini to parse HTML results and identify matching profiles.
- Filters and selects the most relevant LinkedIn entry.
- Analyzes the data to generate a buyer persona and follow-up strategy.
- Sends a styled email with insights and outreach steps.
