## Description

This template implements a professional Double Opt-In email verification system using Google Sheets as a database. The workflow collects user emails, generates unique verification codes, stores them securely, and validates user access before proceeding with your main form.

### How it Works

1. User submits their email through an initial form
2. System generates a unique 6-digit verification code
3. Code is stored in Google Sheets along with user data
4. Verification email is sent to the user
5. User enters the code to verify their email
6. Upon successful verification, user accesses the main form
