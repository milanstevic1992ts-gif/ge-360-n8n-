## Description

## 📌 Overview
This workflow automatically processes incoming **Shopify/Gmail leads** and pushes them into **HubSpot** as both **Contacts** and **Deals**.  

It helps sales and marketing teams **capture leads instantly**, enrich CRM data, and avoid missed opportunities.

## ⚡ How it works
1. **Trigger**: Watches for new emails in Gmail.  
2. **Extract Data**: Parses email body (Name, Email, City, Phone, Message, Product URL/Title).  
3. **Condition**: Checks if sender is Shopify before processing.  
4. **HubSpot**:  
   - Creates/updates a **Contact** with customer details.  
   - Creates a **Deal** associated with that contact.
