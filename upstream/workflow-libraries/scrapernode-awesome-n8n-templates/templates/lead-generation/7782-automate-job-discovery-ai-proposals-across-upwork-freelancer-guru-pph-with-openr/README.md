# 📘 Beginner Setup Guide

**Workflow: Upwork Job Application Automation with Vollna API**

This workflow automates the process of:

* Reading new jobs from a Vollna RSS feed,
* Extracting job title, budget, and source,
* Using AI to generate a tailored proposal,
* Sending the proposal to your email, and
* Saving job details into a Google Sheet.

---

## 1. 📥 Import the Workflow

1. Open your **n8n dashboard**.
2. Click **Import** in the top-right.
3. Upload the file:
   `Upwork Job Application Automation with Vollna API Updated.json`.

---

## 2. 🔑 Set Up Required Credentials

Before the workflow can run, connect your accounts.

1. **Gmail Credentials**

   * Go to **Credentials** in n8n.
   * Create a new credential: **Gmail OAuth2 API**.
   * Follow the login prompt and grant access.
   * Save it, then select it in the **Send a Message** node.

2. **Google Sheets Credentials**

   * Create a credential for **Google Sheets OAuth2 API**.
   * Connect it to your Google account.
   * Save it, then select it in the **Update Database** node.

3. **OpenRouter / AI API Key**

   * Sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai).
   * Copy your API key.
   * In n8n, create a credential for **OpenRouter API**.
   * Select it in the **OpenRouter Chat Model** node.

---

## 3. ⚙️ Configure the RSS Feed

1. Open the **RSS Feed Trigger** node.
2. Replace `https://www.vollna.com/rss/insertyourlinkhere` with **your personal Vollna RSS feed URL**.

   * You can get this from your Vollna account (filtering for Upwork jobs).

---

## 4. 🌀 Understand the Loop

This workflow uses **Loop Over Items** to process multiple jobs one by one.

* **Loop branch (Output 1)** → Processes each job (Extract, Decode, AI Proposal, Save to DB).
* **Done branch (Output 2)** → Would normally run once all jobs are processed. (Here, it’s not used — instead, the loop cycles back until no jobs are left.)

So the workflow ensures **every job from RSS is handled**.

---

## 5. 📧 Email Setup

The **Send a Message** node will send proposals to your email.

* Default recipient: `denorgerald@gmail.com`.
* Change this in the **Send a Message → Send To** field to your own email.

---

## 6. 📊 Google Sheets Setup
[Get Your Google Sheets Copy](Get your Google Sheets copy)

The **Update Database** node writes job data to your Google Sheet.

* It’s already linked to this sheet:
  `Upwork Jobs Automation → upwork_jobs`
* Replace with your own Google Sheet ID if you want.

  * Copy your sheet’s URL, e.g.:

    ```
    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/&lt;YOUR_SHEET_ID&gt;/edit#gid=0
    ```
  * Paste `&lt;YOUR_SHEET_ID&gt;` into the **Document ID**.
  * Update **Sheet Name** if needed (default is `upwork_jobs`).

---

## 7. ▶️ Test the Workflow

1. Click **Execute Workflow**.
2. The RSS Trigger will fetch jobs.
3. You should see each job processed step by step:

   * Title & Budget extracted
   * URL decoded
   * Proposal generated by AI
   * Email sent
   * Row added to Google Sheet

---

## 8. 🔄 Activate Automation

* When satisfied, toggle the **workflow to Active**.
* It will check the RSS feed every **5 minutes** (you can adjust this in the RSS Trigger).


Your Upwork Job Application Automation is now ready to help you discover and apply to more opportunities automatically. Remember to monitor the system regularly and adjust settings based on your results.

**Happy freelancing!** 🚀🚀
