> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

# Monitoring Job Changes on LinkedIn
## Use Case
This automation tracks job changes among your LinkedIn connections and extracts relevant details. It's ideal for triggering timely outreach, updating CRM records, or feeding lead scoring workflows based on new roles.

## What This Automation Does
It scrapes your LinkedIn "Job Changes" feed and returns:
- Name of the person
- Their new position
- LinkedIn profile URL
- Functional category (e.g., marketing, sales, HR, executive)

Each run processes 5 job changes at a time.

## How It Works
1. **Manual Trigger**: Starts the workflow when the user clicks "Test workflow."
2. **Airtop Enrichment**: Navigates to the LinkedIn job changes page and extracts:
   - `name`
   - `new_position`
   - `linkedin_profile_url`
   - `position_function` (classification such as marketing, sales, HR, etc.)
3. **Formatting**: Output is structured into clean JSON for use in further workflows.

## Setup Requirements
1. [Airtop Profile](https://portal.airtop.ai/browser-profiles) connected to LinkedIn
2. Airtop API key configured in n8n
3. A LinkedIn account with a populated “Job Changes” feed

## Next Steps
- **Automate Alerts**: Add Slack, email, or CRM integrations to notify your team.
- **Enrich and Score Leads**: Chain this with your ICP scoring workflow to evaluate new roles.
- **Customize Scope**: Expand extraction to more than 5 job changes or add filters based on job titles or functions.
