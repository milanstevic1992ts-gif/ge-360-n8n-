> ⚡ **201 views** · 🎣 [Lead Generation & Enrichment](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

# Purpose & Audience

3. Extracts complete business details: name, address, phone, website, rating, and description
4. Scrapes business websites to find email addresses automatically
5. Handles edge cases gracefully: businesses without websites, failed scrapes, or missing data
6. Batches API requests with intelligent rate limiting to respect Google's quotas
