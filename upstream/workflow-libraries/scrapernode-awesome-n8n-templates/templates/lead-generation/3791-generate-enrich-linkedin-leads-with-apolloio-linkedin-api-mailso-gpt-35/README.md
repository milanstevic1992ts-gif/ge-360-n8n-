> ⚡ **24,365 views** · 🎣 [Lead Generation & Enrichment](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## ⚙️ How This Workflow Works

The workflow is broken down into several key steps, each designed to help you build and enrich a valuable list of LinkedIn leads:

### 1. 🔑 Lead Discovery (Keyword Search via Apollo)
- Pulls leads using **Apollo.io's API** based on keywords, industries, or job titles.
- Saves lead name, title, company, and LinkedIn URL to your Google Sheet.
- You can replace the trigger node from the form node to a webhook, whatsapp, telegram, etc, any way for you to send over your query variables over to initiate the workflow.

### 2. 🧠 Username Extraction (from LinkedIn URL)
- Extracts the **LinkedIn username** from profile URLs using a simple script node.
- This is required for further enrichment via RapidAPI.

### 3. ✉️ Email Lookup (via Apollo User ID)
- Uses the **Apollo User ID** to retrieve the lead’s **verified work email**.
- Ensures high-quality leads with reliable contact info.
- To double check that the email is currently valid, we use the mail.so api and filter out emails that fail deliverability and mx-record check. We don't wanna risk sending emails to no longer existent addresses, right?

### 4. 🧾 Profile Summary Enrichment (via RapidAPI)
- Queries the **LinkedIn Data API** to fetch a lead’s **profile summary/bio**.
- Gives you a deeper understanding of their background and expertise.

### 5. 📰 Recent Activity Collection (Posts & Reposts)
- Retrieves **recent posts or reposts** from each lead’s profile.
- Great for tailoring outreach with reference to what they’re currently talking about.

### 6. 🗂️ Leads Database Update
- All enriched data is written to the same Google Sheet.
- New columns are filled in without overwriting existing data.

## ✅ Smart Retry & Row Status Logic

Every subworkflow includes a **fail-safe mechanism** to ensure:

- ✅ Each row has status columns (e.g., `done`, `failed`, `pending`).
- 🕒 A **scheduled retry workflow** resets failed rows to `pending` after **2 weeks** (customizable).
- 💬 This gives failed enrichments another chance to be processed later, reducing data loss.

## 🔐 Required API Keys

To use this workflow, you’ll need the following credentials:

### 🧩 Apollo.io
- Sign up and get your key here: [Apollo.io API Keys](https://developer.apollo.io/keys/)
- ⚠️ **Important:** Toggle the **“Master API Key”** option to **ON** when generating your key.  
This ensures the same key can be used for all Apollo endpoints in this workflow.

### 🌐 RapidAPI (LinkedIn Data API)
- Subscribe to the API here: [LinkedIn Data API on RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/rockapis-rockapis-default/api/linkedin-data-api)
- Use the key in the `x-rapidapi-key` header in the relevant nodes.

### ✉️ Mail.so
- Sign up and get your key here: [Mail.so API](https://mails.so/dashboard/api)


&gt; 💡 For both APIs, set up the credentials in **n8n as “Generic Credential”** types.  
This way, you won’t need to reconfigure the headers in each node.

---

## 🛠️ Customization Options

- Modify the Apollo filters (location, industry, seniority) to target your ideal customers.
- Change retry interval in the scheduler (e.g., weekly instead of 2 weeks).
- Connect the database to your email campaign tool like Mailchimp or Instantly.ai.
- Replace the AI nodes with your desired AI agents and customize the system messages further to get desired results.
