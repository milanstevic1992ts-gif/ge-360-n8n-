> ⚡ **273 views** · 🎣 [Lead Generation & Enrichment](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

## Scrape LinkedIn Post Comments & Reactions → Export to Google Sheets
![Screenshot 20251118 at 09.00.56.png](fileId:3337)
This workflow lets you quickly extract all **comments** and **reactions** from any public LinkedIn post using Browserflow, then automatically saves the results into two separate Google Sheets tabs. Perfect for audience research, content analysis, engagement tracking, or social listening.


## ⚠️ Disclaimer – Community Node Notice
This template uses a verified community node available inside the n8n cloud environment.
To use it, go to “Nodes” → search for:

*Browserflow for Linkedin*

…and click Install.
It’s officially verified and accessible directly from n8n cloud.

In case you wish to run this template locally, you need to go to the settings, click community nodes and search for *n8n-nodes-browserflow*. Then after installing you can start using the actions in this node.

## How it works

• You click **Execute workflow** to manually start the process
• The workflow fetches your Google Sheet to grab all the post urls that have not been scraped yet.
• The Posts tab is updated so it registered which post was scraped.
• Browserflow scrapes the LinkedIn post (comments + reactions) based on the post URL you provide
• The workflow splits the scraped data into two streams:
 — one for **reactions**
 — one for **comments**
• Each item is appended into its matching Google Sheet tab — keeping everything clean and organized
