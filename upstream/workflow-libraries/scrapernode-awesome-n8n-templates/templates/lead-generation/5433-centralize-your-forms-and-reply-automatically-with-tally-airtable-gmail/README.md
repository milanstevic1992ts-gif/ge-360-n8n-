## Description

**Still manually copy-pasting your Tally form responses?**

What if every submission went straight into Airtable — and the user got an automatic email right after?

That’s exactly what this workflow does.
No code, no headache — just a simple and fast automation:

**Tally → Airtable → Gmail.**

## STEP 1 — Capture Tally Form Responses

![AutomateTallyFormn8netape2.png](fileId:1622)

### Goal
Trigger the workflow automatically every time someone submits your Tally form.

### What we're setting up
A webhook that catches form responses and kicks off the rest of the flow.

### Steps to follow
Add a Webhook node

Parameter :	Value
Method :	POST
Path :	formulaire-tally
Authentication : None
Respond : Immediately


Save the workflow
→ This will generate a URL like:

*https://your-workspace.n8n.cloud/webhook-test/formulaire-tally*
*
💡 Use the Test URL first (found under Parameters &gt; Test URL)

Head over to Tally
Go to your form → Form Settings &gt; Integrations &gt; Webhooks
Paste the Test URL into the Webhook field
Enable the webhook ✅

Submit a test entry
→ Tally won’t send anything until a real submission is made.
This step is required for n8n to capture the structure.

### Expected output

![AutomateTallyFormn8netape1.png](fileId:1615)

n8n receives a JSON object containing:

General info (IDs, timestamps, etc.)

A fields[] array with all the form inputs (name, email, etc.)

Each field is nicely structured with a label, key, type, and most importantly, a value.

Perfect foundation for the next step: data cleanup.

## STEP 2 — Clean and Structure the Form Data (Set node)
![AutomateTallyFormn8netape4.png](fileId:1602)

### Goal

Take the raw data sent by Tally and turn it into clean, readable JSON that's easy to use in the rest of the workflow.

Tally sends the responses inside a big array called field.

Can you grab a field directly with something like {{$json["fields"][3]["value"]}}? Yes.

But a good workflow is like a sock drawer — when everything’s folded and labeled, life’s just easier.

So we’re going to clean it up using a Set node.

### Steps to follow

Add a Set node right after the Webhook.

Enable the “Keep only set” option.

Define the following fields in the Set node:

Field name:	Expression
full_name:	{{$json["fields"][0]["value"]}}
company_name:	{{$json["fields"][1]["value"]}}
job_title:	{{$json["fields"][2]["value"]}}
email:	{{$json["fields"][3]["value"]}}
phone_number:	{{$json["fields"][4]["value"] ?? ""}}
submission_date:	{{$now.toISOString()}}

⚠️ The order of fields[] depends on your Tally form. If you change the question order, make sure to update these indexes accordingly.

### Expected output

You’ll get a clean, structured JSON like this:

![AutomateTallyFormn8netape5.png](fileId:1612)

Now your data is clear, labeled, and ready for the rest of your workflow.

## STEP 3 — Save Data in Airtable

![AutomateTallyFormn8netape6.png](fileId:1617)

## Goal

Every time someone submits your Tally form, their info is automatically added to an Airtable base. No more copy-pasting — everything lands right where it should.

## Steps to follow
1. Create your Airtable base
Start by creating a base named Leads (or whatever you prefer), with a table called Form Submissions.

Add the following columns in this exact order so everything maps correctly later:

### Generate an Airtable token
So n8n can send data into your base:

Go to 👉 [ https://airtable.com/create/tokens](https://airtable.com/create/tokens
)

Click Create token

Give it a name (e.g. Tally Automation)

Check the following permissions:

data.records:read

data.records:write

schema.bases:read

Under Base access, either choose your base manually or select “All current and future bases”

Click Create token and copy the generated key

![AutomateTallyFormn8netape8.png](fileId:1613)
### Add configure the Airtable node in n8n

Node: Airtable

Operation: Create

Authentication: Personal Access Token

Paste your token

n8n will suggest your base and table (or you can manually grab the IDs from the URL:
https://airtable.com/appXXXXXXXX/tblYYYYYYYY/...)

Map your fields
Inside the Airtable node, add the following field mappings:

![AutomateTallyFormn8netape9.png](fileId:1616)


Every new Tally form submission automatically creates a new row in your Airtable base.

## STEP 4 — Send an Automatic Confirmation Email

![AutomateTallyFormn8netape10.png](fileId:1623)

### Goal

Send a professional email as soon as a form is completed

### Steps to follow

1. Add a Wait node

You don’t want the email to go out instantly — it feels cold and robotic.
→ Add a Wait node right after Airtable.

Mode: Wait for a period of time

Delay: 5 to 10 minutes

Unit: Minutes

2. Add a Gmail &gt; Send Email node
Authentication: OAuth2

Connect a Gmail account (business or test)
⚠️ No API keys here — Gmail requires OAuth.

3. Configure the Send Email node

![AutomateTallyFormn8netape11.png](fileId:1614)

Field	Value

Credential to connect with Gmail account via OAuth2

Resource :	Message
Operation :	Send
To :	{{ $json.fields["Email"] }}
Subject : Thanks for reaching out!
Email Type : HTML
Message: (but do the mapping correctly using the Input so that lead receives its name correctly )

## End of the Workflow

And that’s it — your automation is live!

Your lead fills out the Tally form → the info goes to Airtable → they get a clean, professional email without you doing a thing.
