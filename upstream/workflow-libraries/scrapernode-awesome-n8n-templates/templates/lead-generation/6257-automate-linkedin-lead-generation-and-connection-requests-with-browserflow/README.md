# 🎣 Automate LinkedIn lead generation and connection requests with Browserflow

> ⚡ **1,485 views** · 🎣 [Lead Generation & Enrichment](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## ⚠️ **Disclaimer – Community Node Notice**
This template uses a verified community node available inside the n8n cloud environment.
To use it, go to "Nodes" → search for:

*Browserflow for Linkedin*

…and click Install.
It’s officially verified and accessible directly from n8n cloud.

## **🛠️ How to Use**

###### Trigger: Manual Start
Initiates the workflow manually via the “Test workflow” button, giving you full control.

###### Scrape LinkedIn Profiles
Uses the Browserflow automation to extract profile links from a LinkedIn search or keyword query.

###### Split Out Results
Converts the list of profiles into individual items for single-profile processing.

###### Loop Through Each Profile
Ensures each LinkedIn profile is handled one at a time, avoiding simultaneous actions.

###### Check Existing Connection
Verifies if you’re already connected with the lead on LinkedIn.

###### Conditional Logic

✅ Already Connected → Skip to next profile

❌ Not Connected → Continue to next step

###### Send Connection Invite
Sends a LinkedIn connection request, optionally with a personalized message.
