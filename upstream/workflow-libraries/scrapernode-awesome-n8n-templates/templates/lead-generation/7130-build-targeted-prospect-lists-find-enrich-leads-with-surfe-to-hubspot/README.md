## Description

## 🚀 Build Hyper-Targeted Prospecting Lists with Surfe & HubSpot

This template automatically discovers companies that match your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), finds the right people inside those companies and enriches them — ready to drop straight into HubSpot. Launch the workflow, sit back, and get a clean list of validated prospects in minutes.

---

## 1. ❓ What Problem Does This Solve?

Sourcing prospects that truly fit your ICP is slow and repetitive. You jump between databases, copy domains, hunt down decision-makers, and then still have to enrich emails and phone numbers one by one.

This workflow replaces all that manual effort:

1. It queries Surfe’s database for companies that match your exact industry, size, revenue and geography filters.
2. It pulls the best-fit people inside each company and enriches them in bulk.
3. It keeps only records with both a direct email *and* mobile phone, then syncs them to HubSpot automatically.

No spreadsheets, no copy-paste — just a fresh, qualified prospect list ready for outreach.

---

## 2. 🧰 Prerequisites

You’ll need:

- A self-hosted or cloud instance of **n8n**
- A **Surfe API Key**
- A **HubSpot** Private App Token with contact read/write scopes
- A **Gmail** account (OAuth2) for the completion notification
- The workflow JSON file linked above

## 3. 📌 Search ICP Companies Configuration — Fine-Tune Your Targeting

![Screenshot 20250807 at 12.13.11.png](fileId:1984)

### 3.1 Editing the JSON

Every targeting rule lives inside the **“🔍 Search ICP Companies”** HTTP node.

Open the node `Search ICP Companies` → `*Parameters* tab` → `*JSON Body*` to edit the filters.

| Filter | JSON path | What it does | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **industries** | `filters.industries` | Narrow to specific verticals (case-sensitive strings) | `["Software","Apps","SaaS"]` |
| **employeeCount.from / to** | `filters.employeeCount` | from / to  | `1 / 35` |
| **countries** | `filters.countries` | 2-letter ISO codes | `["FR","DE"]` |
| **revenues** | `filters.revenues` | Annual revenue brackets | `["1-10M"]` |
| **limit** | `limit` | Companies per run | `20` |

### 3.2 Where to find allowed values

Surfe exposes an **“🗂 Get Filters”** endpoint that returns every accepted value for:

- `industries`
- `employeeCounts`
- `revenues`
- `countries` (always ISO-2 codes)

You can hit it with a simple `GET /v1/people/search/filters` request or browse the interactive docs here:

https://developers.surfe.com/public-008-people-filters [developers.surfe.com](https://developers.surfe.com/public-008-people-filters)

For company-level searches, the same enumerations apply.
