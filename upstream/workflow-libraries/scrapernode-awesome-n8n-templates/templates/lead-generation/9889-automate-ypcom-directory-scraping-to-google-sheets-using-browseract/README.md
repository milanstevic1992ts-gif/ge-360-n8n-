> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Automate Directory Scraping to Google Sheets using BrowserAct

### This n8n template helps you generate local business leads by automatically scraping online directories and saving the results directly to a spreadsheet.

This workflow is perfect for sales teams, marketing agencies, or anyone looking to build a list of local business leads by scraping online directories like YP.com.

---
### **Self-Hosted Only** 
This Workflow uses a community contribution and is designed and tested for **self-hosted n8n instances** only.

---
### How it works
* The workflow is triggered **manually**. You can set the `business_category` and `city_location` inputs in the "Run a workflow task" node.
* A **BrowserAct** node initiates the web scraping task on your BrowserAct account using the template specified.
* A second **BrowserAct** node ("Get details of a workflow task") patiently waits for the scraping job to finish before allowing the workflow to proceed.
* A **Code** node takes the raw output from the scraper (which is a single JSON string) and correctly parses it, splitting the data into individual items for each business.
* Finally, a **Google Sheets** node appends or updates each business as a new row in your spreadsheet, matching on "Company Name" to prevent duplicates.

---
### Requirements
* **BrowserAct** API account for web scraping
* **BrowserAct** "**Online Directory Lead Scraper (YP.com)**" Template
* **BrowserAct** n8n Community Node -&gt; ([n8n Nodes BrowserAct](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-browseract-workflows))
* **Google Sheets** credentials for saving the leads
