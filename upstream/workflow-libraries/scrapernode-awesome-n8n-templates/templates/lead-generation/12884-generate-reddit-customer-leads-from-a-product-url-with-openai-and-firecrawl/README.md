## Description

# Reddit Lead Generator - Frontend Integrated (Productized Version)

## Overview
Production-ready Reddit lead generation system with progressive data loading for optimal UX. This workflow integrates with a web frontend, sending results in real-time as they're processed instead of waiting for everything to complete.

## Key Features

✅ **Progressive Loading** - Users see results as they come in (website analysis → keywords → conversations)  
✅ **5 Response Stages** - Data sent in batches for better UX  
✅ **Webhook Authentication** - Secured with API key headers  
✅ **Frontend Ready** - Built to work with the companion web app  
✅ **Real-Time Updates** - No waiting for 2-minute batch processing  

## What This Workflow Does

1. Receives product URL from frontend via webhook
2. Immediately responds "processing started"
3. Analyzes website with Firecrawl → sends data to frontend
4. Generates 10 keywords with OpenAI → sends to frontend
5. Searches Reddit and filters conversations → sends in 3 batches
6. Frontend displays results progressively as they arrive

## Response Flow

**Stage 1:** `website_analysis` - Product details, favicon, summary  
**Stage 2:** `keywords_generated` - All 10 keywords  
**Stage 3:** `conversations_partial1` - First keyword results  
**Stage 4:** `conversations_partial2` - Second keyword results  
**Stage 5:** `conversations_final` - Remaining keywords (3-10) in markdown  

## Quick Setup

1. **Set Environment Variables** in the "Set Environment Variables" node:
   - `BACKEND_API_URL` - Your frontend API endpoint
   - `WEBHOOK_API_KEY` - Your webhook security key

2. **Configure Credentials:**

   - Reddit OAuth2
   - OpenAI API

3. **Deploy Frontend & Backend:**
