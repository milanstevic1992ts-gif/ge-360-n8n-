> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

- The results are written to a new Google Sheet with the found contacts and their source pages.

### How to use

In Google Sheets:
- Create a Google Sheet, rename the sheet websites, and add all the domains or URLs you want to scan (one per row).


In this Workflow:
- Open “Set google sheet URL & original sheet name” and replace the example Google Sheet URL and the name of the source sheet (e.g., websites).

- Connect your Apify account.


In Apify:
