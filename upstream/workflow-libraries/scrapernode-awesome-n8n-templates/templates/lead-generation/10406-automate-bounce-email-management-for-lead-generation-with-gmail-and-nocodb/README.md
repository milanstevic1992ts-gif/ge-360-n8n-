## Description

# 📬 SPAM MANAGER FOR LEAD GENERATION

Automatically identifies and manages spam replies from your outreach inbox; such as “Delivery failed” or “There was a problem with your delivery” which comes from "mailer-daemon@googlemail.com" for Gmail. This is to remove these messages to keep your email lists clean and improve domain reputation.

---

## 🎯 Who it’s for

This workflow is designed for **lead generation managers, outreach specialists, and freelancers** who send cold or automated emails at scale.

It helps you **automatically filter and manage bounce or spam responses** without manually combing through your inbox, ensuring your sender domain stays healthy and your lead lists remain accurate.

---

## ⚙️ How it works

1. **Trigger:** Watches your Gmail inbox for replies from system senders like `mailer-daemon@googlemail.com`.  
2. **Extract Email:** Pulls out the email address from each bounce or spam message.  
3. **Merge:** Compares the extracted address with your **main lead sheet**.  
4. **Update Sheet:**  
   - If the email exists in your main sheet, it updates that record’s **SPAM field** to `"YES"`.  
   - Otherwise, it adds the address to a dedicated **Unsubscribe or Bad Emails table**.  
5. **Mark as Read:** Tags and marks the email as processed in Gmail for better visibility.

---

## 🧩 Requirements

To run this workflow, you’ll need:
- **Gmail Credentials** → For reading and tagging emails.  
- **NocoDB API Token** → For reading and updating your lead list and spam records.(You can use Sheets, Airtable or any other DB you use).  

Both can be securely added through the **n8n Credentials Manager**.

---

## 🧠 How to Customize

- **Sender Filter:** Change the Gmail Trigger to include other mailer domains or error messages.  
- **Data Storage:** Replace NocoDB with Google Sheets or Airtable.  
- **Tagging:** Adjust or remove the Gmail label used for spam-marked messages.  
- **Message Matching:** Edit the `MERGE` code node to fit your column names (e.g., `Email`, `Address`, etc.).  

---

## 💡 Why this workflow matters

By automating spam and bounce handling, you:
- Keep your **lead database clean and current**  
- Reduce bounce rates and spam flags  
- Improve your **email deliverability and sender score**  
- Save time spent manually checking failed emails  

---

## 🪄 Quick Setup Tips

- Add your Gmail and DB credentials under the **Credentials tab**.  
- Update the DB project and table IDs in relevant nodes.  
- Test with a few known bounce messages to verify connection and matching.  
- Optional: Add a “SPAM” tag in Gmail for quick inbox filtering. "UNSUBSCRIBE" is used in this workflow.
