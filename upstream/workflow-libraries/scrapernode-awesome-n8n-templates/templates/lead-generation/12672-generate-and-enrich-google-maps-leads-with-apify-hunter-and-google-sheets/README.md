## Description

## How it works  
This workflow automatically scrapes business leads from Google Maps on a daily schedule and ensures only high-quality, unique leads are processed. New businesses are cleaned, validated, and deduplicated against an existing Google Sheets database before enrichment begins. Verified emails are enriched using domain-based lookup and classified by confidence. Finally, the workflow sends a detailed email report and stores all enriched leads in Google Sheets for ongoing tracking.

## Step-by-step  
- **Scrape & deduplicate leads**  
  - **Schedule Trigger** – Runs the workflow automatically at a fixed time each day.  
  - **Google Maps Scraper** – Scrapes business listings based on search query and location.  
  - **Format & Validate Data** – Cleans fields, normalizes data, and scores lead quality.  
  - **Check Existing Leads** – Reads existing records from Google Sheets.  
  - **Deduplicate Leads** – Removes businesses already stored in the database.  
  - **Format Error Data** – Captures and structures scraper or processing errors.  
  - **Error Notification** – Sends an email alert if the workflow fails.

- **Enrich emails**  
  - **Has New Leads?** – Checks whether any new unique leads remain after deduplication.  
  - **Batch for AI Processing** – Splits leads into small batches to control API usage.  
  - **HTTP Request (Hunter)** – Performs domain search to find professional emails.  
  - **Merge & Validate Results** – Selects the best email and assigns confidence levels.  
  - **No New Leads Notification** – Sends a message when no new leads are found.

- **Report & store results**  
  - **High Confidence Leads?** – Separates outreach-ready leads from lower-confidence ones.  
  - **Build Email Report** – Generates a detailed HTML report with lead analytics.  
  - **Send Email Report** – Emails the daily lead summary to stakeholders.  
  - **Prepare Sheet Data** – Formats enriched leads for storage.  
  - **Save to Google Sheets** – Appends or updates leads in the sheet.  
  - **Merge** – Synchronizes parallel execution paths.  
  - **Wait** – Controls workflow execution flow and batching cycles.
