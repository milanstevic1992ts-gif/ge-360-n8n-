> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

## This n8n template from [Intuz](https://www.intuz.com/) provides a complete and automated solution for deep-dive lead research and hyper-personalized email generation. 

It transforms a basic list of LinkedIn profiles into a campaign-ready database by first enriching contacts with detailed career data and then using AI to craft unique, context-aware emails based on each individual's professional journey.

## Who's this workflow for?
- Sales Development Representatives (SDRs)
- Account Executives (AEs)
- B2B Marketers & Growth Hackers
- Recruiters & Talent Acquisition Specialists
- Startup Founders

## How it works
**1. Scheduled Data Fetch:** The workflow runs automatically on a schedule, fetching a list of leads (containing LinkedIn URLs) from a Google Sheet.

**2. Enrich Profiles with Apify:** For each lead that hasn't been processed, it uses an Apify actor to scrape their LinkedIn profile, extracting key information like their "About" section and detailed work experience.

**3. Update Central Database:** The scraped career history is saved back into a "Profile Data" column in the original Google Sheet, creating a rich, centralized lead profile.

**4. AI Email Personalization:** The workflow sends the complete, enriched profile data to a Google Gemini AI model via LangChain, using a sophisticated prompt that instructs it to act as an expert B2B copywriter.

**5. Craft a Unique Hook**: The AI analyzes the lead's entire career journey to find unique "nuggets"—like long tenure, specific achievements, or unusual career paths—and uses them to write a compelling opening line.

**6. Save the Final Email Draft:** The AI-generated subject line and personalized email body are saved back into the Google Sheet, leaving you with a ready-to-send, hyper-personalized outreach campaign.

## Setup Instructions
**1. Google Sheets Setup:**
- Connect your Google Sheets account to n8n.
- In all three Google Sheets nodes, select your credentials and update the Document ID and Sheet Name to match your lead list.
- Populate your sheet with initial lead data, including at least their LinkedIn URL.

**2. Apify Connection:**
- Connect your Apify account in the Runs Profile Extraction Actor node.

**3. Google Gemini AI Connection:**
- Connect your Google Gemini (PaLM) API account in the Google Gemini Chat Model node.

**4. Configure the Schedule:**
- In the Schedule Trigger node, set the interval for how often you want the workflow to run and process new leads.

**5. Activate Workflow:**
- Save the workflow and toggle the "Active" switch to ON. Your automated research and personalization engine is now active.
