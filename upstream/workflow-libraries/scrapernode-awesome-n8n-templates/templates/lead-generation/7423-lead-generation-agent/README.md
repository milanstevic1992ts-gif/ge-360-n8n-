> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

## **Who this is for**

This workflow is for **digital marketing agencies** or **sales teams** who want to **automatically find business leads** based on industry & location, gather their contact details, and send **personalized cold emails** — all from one form submission.

---

## **What this workflow does**

This workflow starts every time someone submits the **Lead Machine Form**. It then:

* **Scrapes business data** (company name, website, phone, address, category) using **Apify** based on business type & location.
* **Extracts the best email address** from each business website using **Google Gemini AI**.
* **Stores valid leads** in **Google Sheets**.
* **Generates cold email content** (subject + body) with AI based on your preferred tone (Friendly, Professional, Simple).
* **Sends the cold email** via Gmail.
* **Updates the sheet** with send status & timestamp.

---

## **Setup**

To set this workflow up:

1. **Form Trigger** – Customize the “Lead Machine” form fields if needed (Business Type, Location, Lead Number, Email Style).
2. **Apify API** – Add your Apify Actor Endpoint URL in the HTTP Request node.
3. **Google Gemini** – Add credentials for extracting email addresses.
4. **Google Sheets** – Connect your sheet for storing leads & email status.
5. **OpenAI** – Add your credentials for cold email generation.
6. **Gmail** – Connect your Gmail account for sending cold emails.

---

## **How to customize this workflow to your needs**

* Change the **AI email prompt** to reflect your brand’s voice and offer.
* Add **filters** to only target leads that meet specific criteria (e.g., website must exist, email must be verified).
* Modify the **Google Sheets structure** to track extra info like “Follow-up Date” or “Lead Source”.
* Switch Gmail to another email provider if preferred.
