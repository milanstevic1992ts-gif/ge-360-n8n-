## Description

# Scrape physician profiles from BrowserAct to Google Sheets

This workflow automates the process of building a targeted database of healthcare providers by scraping physician details for a specific location and syncing them to your records. It leverages BrowserAct to extract data from healthcare directories and ensures your database stays clean by preventing duplicate entries.

## Target Audience
Medical recruiters, pharmaceutical sales representatives, lead generation specialists, and healthcare data analysts.

## How it works
1. **Define Location**: The workflow starts by setting the target `Location` and `State` in a Set node.
2. **Scrape Data**: A **BrowserAct** node executes a task (using the "Physician Profile Enricher" template) to search a healthcare directory (e.g., Healow) for doctors matching the criteria.
3. **Parse JSON**: A **Code** node takes the raw string output from the scraper and parses it into individual JSON objects.
4. **Update Database**: The workflow uses a **Google Sheets** node to append new records or update existing ones based on the physician's name, preventing duplicates.
5. **Notify Team**: A **Slack** node sends a message to a specific channel to confirm the batch job has finished successfully.

## How to set up
1. **Configure Credentials**: Connect your **BrowserAct**, **Google Sheets**, and **Slack** accounts in n8n.
2. **Prepare BrowserAct**: Ensure the **Physician Profile Enricher** template is saved in your BrowserAct account.
3. **Setup Google Sheet**: Create a new Google Sheet with the required headers (listed below).
4. **Select Spreadsheet**: Open the **Google Sheets** node and select your newly created file and sheet.
5. **Set Variables**: Open the **Define Location** node and input your target `Location` (City) and `State`.
6. **Configure Notification**: Open the **Slack** node and select the channel where you want to receive alerts.

## Google Sheet Headers
To use this workflow, create a Google Sheet with the following headers:
* Name
* Specialty
* Address

## Requirements
* **BrowserAct** account with the **Physician Profile Enricher** template.
* **Google Sheets** account.
* **Slack** account.

## How to customize the workflow
1. **Change the Data Source**: Modify the BrowserAct template to scrape a different directory (e.g., Zocdoc or WebMD) and update the Google Sheet columns accordingly.
2. **Switch Notifications**: Replace the Slack node with a **Microsoft Teams**, **Discord**, or **Email** node to suit your team's communication preferences.
3. **Enrich Data**: Add an **AI Agent** node after the Code node to format addresses or research the specific clinics listed.
