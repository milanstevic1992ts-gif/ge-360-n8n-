# 🎣 Enrich LinkedIn profiles in NocoDB CRM with Apify scraper

> ⚡ **1,085 views** · 🎣 [Lead Generation & Enrichment](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

# Introduction
**Manual LinkedIn data collection is time-consuming, error-prone, and results
  in inconsistent data quality across CRM/database records.**

 This workflow is great for organizations that struggle with:
  - Incomplete contact records with only LinkedIn URLs but missing profile
  details
  - Hours spent manually copying LinkedIn information into databases
  - Inconsistent data formats due to copy-paste from LinkedIn (emojis, styled
  text, special characters)
  - Outdated profile information that doesn't reflect current roles/companies
  - No systematic way to enrich contacts at scale

## Primary Users
1.   Sales & Marketing Teams
2.   Event Organizers & Conference Managers for event materials
4.   Recruitment & HR Professionals
5.   CRM Administrators

## Specific Problems Addressed

  1. Data Completeness: Automatically fills missing profile fields (headline,
  bio, skills, experience)
  2. Data Quality: Sanitizes problematic characters that break
  databases/exports
  3. Time Efficiency: Reduces hours of manual data entry to automated monthly
  updates
  4. Error Handling: Gracefully manages invalid/deleted LinkedIn profiles
  5. Scalability: Processes multiple profiles in batch without manual
  intervention
  6. Standardization: Ensures consistent data format across all records

## Cost
Each URL scraped by Apify costs $0.01 to get all the data above. Apify charges per scrape, regardless of how much dta or fields you extract/use.

# Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites

  1. **n8n Instance:** Access to a running n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
  2. **NocoDB Account:** Database with a table containing LinkedIn URLs
  3. **Apify Account:** Free or paid account for LinkedIn scraping

## Required fields in NocoDB table

### Input:
* single LinkedIn URL

*NocoDB Field name*
```
LinkedIn
```

### Output:
* first/last/full name
* e-mail
* bio
* headline
* profile pic URL
* current role
* country
* skills
* current employer
* employer URL
* experiences (all previous jobs)

Technically you also need an Id field, but that is always there so no need to add it :)
