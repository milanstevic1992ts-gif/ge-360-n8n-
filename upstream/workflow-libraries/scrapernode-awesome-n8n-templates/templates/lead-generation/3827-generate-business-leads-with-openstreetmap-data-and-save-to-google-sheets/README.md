## How it works

This n8n lead generation template provides a powerful solution using n8n core nodes and the free OpenStreetMap Overpass API, allowing you to generate thousands of business leads with comprehensive contact information:

### Data Collection Process

**1. Define Your Queries**
- Create a list of search queries combining keywords (like "real estate", "dentist", etc.) with target locations
- Use both inner areas (specific cities) and outer areas (broader regions) to precisely target your search

**2. Iterative Query Execution**
- The workflow processes each query in sequence, preventing API timeout issues
- Each query triggers a sub-workflow that handles the data extraction process

**3. Data Extraction via OpenStreetMap's Overpass API**
- Searches for businesses matching your keywords in name, description, and relevant OpenStreetMap tags
- Collects comprehensive business data including names, addresses, and contact details from the OpenStreetMap database
- Searches using both regular expressions and exact tag matching for optimal n8n lead generation results

**4. Website Scraping for Additional Information**
- For businesses with websites but missing email addresses, the workflow visits their homepage
- Extracts email addresses using regular expressions for more complete contact information
- Filters out irrelevant emails using configurable patterns

**5. Data Cleaning and Organization**
- Removes duplicate contact information and standardizes data format
- Filters results based on your specific requirements for contact details
- Saves all extracted data to Google Sheets for easy access and management

## Setup

**1. Configure Your Queries:**
- Open the "Run Workflow" node and input your list of queries
- Format queries with outer area, inner area, and keyword (e.g., "California,Los Angeles,real estate")

**2. Optimize Tag Targeting:**
- After initial runs, identify the specific tags used by your target industry
- Update the HTTP Request node with these specific tags to improve result quality
- Common tags include "office", "shop", and "amenity" with industry-specific values

**3. Configure Data Filters:**
- Customize the filter node to keep only results meeting your specific requirements
- Adjust the email filtering regex to remove irrelevant email addresses

**4. Set up Google Sheets Integration:**
- Configure the Google Sheets node to save results to your preferred spreadsheet
- Authorize the connection to your Google account

**5. Run the Workflow:**
- Start the workflow and watch as your Google Sheet fills with comprehensive business leads
- The template automatically handles pagination and rate limiting to prevent API timeouts

The resulting leads include comprehensive contact information such as:
- Business names
- Complete addresses (street, city, postal code)
- Phone numbers
- Email addresses (both from API and website scraping)
- Website URLs
- Social media accounts
- Opening hours
- And more!
