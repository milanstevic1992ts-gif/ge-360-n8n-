> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

## Description

This workflow automatically discovers **decision-maker email addresses** from Google search results using AI.

Starting from a search query, it scrapes organic Google results, extracts company domains, infers likely decision-makers, generates realistic executive email patterns, validates deliverability, and stores only verified emails in Google Sheets.

The workflow is designed to reduce manual research while producing structured, outbound-ready contact data that can be reused across sales, partnerships, recruiting, and research workflows.

## How it works

1. **Trigger**  
   The workflow starts manually or via a webhook with a Google search query.

2. **Google Search Scraping**  
   An Apify node collects organic Google search results for the query.

3. **Result Processing**  
   Each result is processed individually to extract the company name and website domain.

4. **Decision-Maker Inference**  
   An AI model analyzes the company context and identifies likely decision-makers (for example founders, executives, partners, or directors).

5. **Email Pattern Generation**  
   AI generates realistic executive email address candidates based on the company domain.

6. **Inbox Filtering**  
   Generic role-based inboxes (such as info@, support@, or sales@) are removed.

7. **Email Validation**  
   An email validation API checks deliverability and filters out invalid addresses.

8. **Data Structuring**  
   Results are normalized into structured fields for consistent storage.

9. **Storage**  
   Verified emails and company details are logged in Google Sheets.
