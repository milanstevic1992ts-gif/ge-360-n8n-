# Deep Multiline Icebreaker System (AI-Powered Cold Email Personalization)

**Categories:** Lead Generation, AI Marketing, Sales Automation

This workflow creates an advanced AI-powered cold email personalization system that achieves 5-10% reply rates by generating deeply personalized multi-line icebreakers. The system scrapes comprehensive website data, analyzes multiple pages per prospect, and uses advanced AI prompting to create custom email openers that make recipients believe you've personally researched their entire business.

## **Benefits**

- **Revenue-Focused Approach** - System designed around proven $72K/month agency methodologies

## **How It Works**

**Apollo Lead Acquisition:**
- Integrates directly with Apollo.io search URLs through Apify scraper
- Processes 500+ leads per search with comprehensive contact data
- Filters for prospects with both email addresses and accessible websites

**Multi-Page Website Scraping:**
- Scrapes homepage to extract all internal website links
- Processes relative URLs and filters out external/irrelevant links
- Performs intelligent batching to prevent IP blocking during scraping

**Comprehensive Content Analysis:**
- Converts HTML to markdown for efficient AI processing
- Uses GPT-4 to generate detailed abstracts of each webpage
- Aggregates insights from multiple pages into comprehensive prospect profiles

**Advanced AI Icebreaker Generation:**

- Uses proven icebreaker templates that reference non-obvious website details
- Generates personalized openers that imply deep manual research

**Smart Data Processing:**
- Removes duplicate URLs and handles scraping errors gracefully
- Implements token limits to control AI processing costs
- Organizes final output in structured Google Sheets format

## **Required Google Sheets Setup**

Create a Google Sheet with these exact tab and column structures:

**Search URLs Tab:**
- `URL` - Contains Apollo.io search URLs for your target audiences

**Leads Tab (Output):**
- `first_name` - Contact's first name
- `last_name` - Contact's last name  
- `email` - Contact's email address
- `website_url` - Company website URL
- `headline` - Job title/position
- `location` - Geographic location
- `phone_number` - Contact phone (if available)
- `multiline_icebreaker` - AI-generated personalized opener

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Create Google Sheet with "Search URLs" and "Leads" tabs
2. Add your Apollo search URLs to the first tab (one per row)
3. Connect Google Sheets OAuth credentials in n8n
4. Update the Google Sheets document ID in all sheet nodes
5. The workflow reads from Search URLs and outputs to Leads automatically

**Apollo Search URL Format:**
Your search URLs should look like:
`https://app.apollo.io/#/people?personLocations[]=United%20States&personTitles[]=ceo&qKeywords=marketing%20agency&page=1`
