> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Automated B2B Lead Generation from Google Maps to Google Sheets using BrowserAct

### This n8n template automates local lead generation by scraping Google Maps for businesses, saving them to Google Sheets, and notifying you in real-time via Telegram.

This workflow is perfect for sales teams, marketing agencies, and local B2B services looking to build targeted lead lists automatically.

### **Self-Hosted Only** 
This Workflow uses a community contribution and is designed and tested for **self-hosted n8n instances** only.


---
### How it works
* The workflow is triggered **manually**. You can set the `Location`, `Bussines_Category`, and number of leads (`Extracted_Data`) in the first BrowserAct node.
* A **BrowserAct** node ("Run a workflow task") initiates the scraping job on Google Maps using your specified criteria.
* A second **BrowserAct** node ("Get details of a workflow task") pauses the workflow and waits for the scraping task to be 100% complete.
* A **Code** node takes the raw JSON string output from the scraper and correctly parses it, splitting the data into individual items (one for each business).
* A **Google Sheets** node appends or updates each lead into your spreadsheet, matching on the "Name" column to prevent duplicate entries.
* Finally, a **Telegram** node sends a message with the new lead's details to your specified chat, providing instant notification.

* **BrowserAct** API account for web scraping
