> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

# n8n Lead Qualification & Sales Intelligence Workflow (Top of Funnel)

### Overview / Purpose
This workflow automatically processes new free-trial / lead sign-ups in real time:

- Catches a webhook from any source (Webflow form, Intercom, custom agent, etc.)
- Filters out personal / disposable / .edu emails → only business emails continue
- Validates the company website is live
- Scrapes the website with Firecrawl to find the official LinkedIn company page
- Enriches the company via AI Agent (Scrapin.io) → pulls name, follower count, headcount, HQ location, industry, and clean description
- Runs a multi-factor scoring engine (Location + Headcount + Industry)
- Sends a beautiful rich Slack notification to the sales team with score, rating, and quick-action buttons
- Segments the lead by score tier (Very High / High / Mid / Low)
- Checks if the lead already exists in Instantly
- Adds qualified leads to the correct Instantly campaign with first/last name extracted from email

### Core Flow (Step-by-Step)

1. **Webhook** – Trigger (POST /new-lead)
2. **Extract Email Root Domain** – Pulls `@company.com` part
3. **Blacklist Regex Domains** – Blocks all personal, free, and .edu emails
4. **Check Email Not Null** – Safety gate
5. **Check if Website Exists** – HEAD request (continues only on 200-399)
6. **Firecrawl Scrape** – Scrapes homepage looking for LinkedIn URL in footer/links
7. **Extract LinkedIn Url** – Code node that finds and cleans `/company/` URL
8. **Check LinkedIn Not Null + Is Company Page** – Rejects personal profiles
9. **LinkedIn Agent** (AI Agent)
   - Uses Scrapin.io enrichment tool
   - Structured output: company_name, followers, employee_count, headquarters_location, industry, description
10. **Audit LI Results** – Ensures all key fields returned
11. **Sanitize Description** – Cleans Unicode, newlines, caps length for Slack
12. **Normalize Country** – GPT-4.1-nano turns "Sheridan, US" → "United States"
13. **Score Country** – Code node (0–10 points based on market tier)
14. **Score Staff Count** – Code node (0–10 points based on headcount buckets)
15. **Industry Scoring** – Code node (normalizes raw industry + 0–10 points)
16. **Algo Score** – Final score = weighted average → 0–100 + rating label ("Excellent Fit", "Good Fit", etc.)
17. **Send to Slack** – Rich blocks with:
    - Email, Company Name, Location (+score), Staff Count (+score), Followers, Industry (+score)
    - Clean description
    - Final Score + Rating
    - Buttons: Visit LinkedIn + Visit Website
18. **Score-Based Routing**
    - Very High (90–100)
    - High (70–89)
    - Mid (50–69)
    - Low (0–49)
19. **Instantly Checks** – For each tier: search if lead already exists
20. **Extract Name From Email** (GPT) – Turns `john.smith@company.com` → First/Last Name (or "there")
21. **Wait** nodes (optional delay before adding)
22. **Add Lead to Campaign** – Pushes to Instantly with website custom field

### Scoring Logic (Fully Configurable in Code Nodes)

Based on your ICP, narrow down your scoring based on how you want to segment.

### What Makes This Workflow Powerful
- Zero manual work after webhook
- Rich, actionable Slack alerts (sales team loves it)
- Smart scoring that matches real ICP
- Built-in deduplication with Instantly
- Fully modular code nodes (easy to tweak scoring without breaking anything)
- Heavy error handling and safety gates
