## Workflow Overview

### Node 1: When chat message received
This node creates an interactive chat interface where users can describe their prospecting criteria in natural language.

- **Type:** Chat Trigger
- **Purpose:** Accept natural language queries like "Get 5 marketing leaders at fintech startups who joined in the past year and have valid contact information"
- **Example Prompts:**
  - "Find SaaS executives in New York with 50-200 employees"
  - "Get marketing directors at healthcare companies"
  - "Show me VPs at fintech startups with recent funding"

### Node 2: Chat or Refinement
This code node manages the conversation flow, handling both initial user queries and validation error feedback.

- **Function:** Routes either the original chat input or validation error messages to the AI Agent
- **Dynamic Input:** Combines `chatInput` and `errorInput` fields
- **Purpose:** Creates a feedback loop for validation error correction

### Node 3: AI Agent
The core intelligence node that interprets natural language and generates structured API calls.

**Functionality:**
- Interprets user intent from natural language queries
- Maps concepts to Explorium API filters (job levels, departments, company size, revenue, location, etc.)
- Generates valid JSON requests with precise filter criteria
- Handles off-topic queries with helpful guidance
- Connected to MCP Client for real-time filter specifications

**AI Components:**
- **Anthropic Chat Model:** Claude Sonnet 4 for query interpretation
- **Simple Memory:** Maintains conversation context (100 message window)
- **Output Parser:** Structured JSON output with schema validation
- **MCP Client:** Connected to `https://mcp.explorium.ai/mcp` for Explorium specifications

**System Instructions:**
- Expert in converting natural language to Explorium API filters
- Can revise previous responses based on validation errors
- Strict adherence to allowed filter values and formats
- Default settings: `mode: "full"`, `size: 10000`, `page_size: 100`, `has_email: true`

### Node 4: API Call Validation
This code node validates the AI-generated API request against Explorium's filter specifications.

**Validation Checks:**
- Filter key validity (only allowed filters from approved list)
- Value format correctness (enums, ranges, country codes)
- No duplicate values in arrays
- Proper range structure for experience fields (`total_experience_months`, `current_role_months`)
- Required field presence

**Allowed Filters:**
- `country_code`, `region_country_code`, `company_country_code`, `company_region_country_code`
- `company_size`, `company_revenue`, `company_age`, `number_of_locations`
- `google_category`, `naics_category`, `linkedin_category`, `company_name`
- `city_region_country`, `website_keywords`
- `has_email`, `has_phone_number`
- `job_level`, `job_department`, `job_title`
- `business_id`, `total_experience_months`, `current_role_months`

**Output:**
- `isValid`: Boolean validation status
- `validationErrors`: Array of specific error messages

### Node 5: Is API Call Valid?
Conditional routing node that determines the next step based on validation results.

- **If Valid:** Proceed to Explorium API: Fetch Prospects
- **If Invalid:** Route to Validation Prompter for correction

### Node 6: Validation Prompter
Generates detailed error feedback for the AI Agent when validation fails.
This creates a self-correcting loop where the AI learns from validation errors and regenerates compliant requests by routing back to Node 2 (Chat or Refinement).

### Node 7: Explorium API: Fetch Prospects
Makes the validated API call to Explorium's prospect database.

- **Method:** POST
- **Endpoint:** `/v1/prospects/fetch`
- **Authentication:** Header Auth (Bearer token)
- **Input:** JSON with filters, mode, size, page_size, page
- **Returns:** Array of matched prospects with prospect IDs based on filter criteria

### Node 8: Pull Prospect IDs
Extracts prospect IDs from the fetch response for bulk enrichment.

- **Input:** Full fetch response with prospect data
- **Output:** Array of `prospect_id` values formatted for enrichment API

### Node 9: Explorium API: Contact Enrichment
Single enrichment node that enhances prospect data with both contact and profile information.

- **Method:** POST
- **Endpoint:** `/v1/prospects/enrich`
- **Enrichment Types:** contacts, profiles
- **Authentication:** Header Auth (Bearer token)
- **Input:** Array of prospect IDs from Node 8

**Returns:**
- **Contacts:** Professional emails (current, verified), phone numbers (mobile, work), email validation status, all available email addresses
- **Profiles:** Full professional history, current role details, company information, skills and expertise, education background, experience timeline, job titles and seniority levels

### Node 10: Clean Output Data
Transforms and structures the enriched data for downstream processing.

### Node 11: Loop Over Items
Iterates through each prospect to generate individualized research and emails.

- **Batch Size:** 1 (processes prospects one at a time)
- **Purpose:** Enable personalized research and email generation for each prospect
- **Loop Control:** Processes until all prospects are complete

### Node 12: Research Email
