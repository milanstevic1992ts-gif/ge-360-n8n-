# 🎣 Enrich Linkedin profile URLs stored in a Google Sheet

> ⚡ **6,714 views** · 🎣 [Lead Generation & Enrichment](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

# Template Information

### Who is this template for?
  **This template is for users looking to retrieve email information from LinkedIn profiles and update Google Sheets with the collected data.**

- [ 🎥 quick set up video](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF9a_UBxWY/xSSlSUzRdxCPtfgx9RzGSg/watch?utm_content=DAF9a_UBxWY&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor)


- **How it works**
  - The template utilizes a series of nodes to fetch email information from LinkedIn profiles. It starts with a Schedule Trigger node that sets the interval for the workflow. The Conditional Check node verifies if certain fields like Name, Gender, Job Title, Summary, and LinkedIn URL are not empty. The HTTP Request node sends a POST request to the specified URL with API key and profile information. The Data Merge node merges the data collected. The Field Editing node modifies the fields as needed. Finally, the Google Sheets Update node updates the Google Sheets with the gathered information.

### Set Up Instructions

1. Make sure to have the necessary credentials and permissions for accessing LinkedIn and Google Sheets.
2. Set up the API key required for the HTTP Request node.
3. Configure the Google Sheets Update node with the appropriate document ID and sheet name.
4. Check and adjust field mappings in the Field Editing node according to your needs.
5. Run the workflow and monitor the updates in your Google Sheets document.

## Overview:


The workflow is designed to find contact information for LinkedIn profile URLs stored in a Google Sheet. It involves various nodes for different operations such as making HTTP requests, scheduling triggers, reading from and updating Google Sheets, field editing, data merging, and conditional checks. A video demonstrating the workflow process can be accessed [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF9a_UBxWY/xSSlSUzRdxCPtfgx9RzGSg/watch?success=true&continue_in_browser=true).

## Using Prospeo.io LinkedIn Email Finder API with cURL

To use the API endpoint "https://api.prospeo.io/linkedin-email-finder" with cURL, follow these steps:

1. Use the cURL command with the following parameters:
   
```bash
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-KEY: your_api_key" \
-d '{
  "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-doe/"
}' \
"https://api.prospeo.io/linkedin-email-finder"
```

2. Replace "your_api_key" with your actual API key.
3. Update the "url" field in the JSON data with the LinkedIn profile URL for which you want to find the email address.

To get access to this API and obtain your API key, you need to sign up on the Prospeo platform and subscribe to their LinkedIn email finder service. Once you have subscribed, you will receive an API key that you can use to authenticate your requests to the API endpoint.
