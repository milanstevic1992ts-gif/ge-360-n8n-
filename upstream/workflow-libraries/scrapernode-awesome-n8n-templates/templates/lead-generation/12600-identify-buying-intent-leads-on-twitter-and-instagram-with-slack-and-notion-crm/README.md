## Description

## 📘 Description
This workflow enables on-demand social lead discovery using a chat-based interface. When a user submits a lead discovery query, the workflow searches Twitter and Instagram for posts where people are actively asking for tools, recommendations, or help solving real problems. An AI agent filters out spam and promotions, extracts only genuine buying-intent posts, and classifies each lead as Low, Medium, or High intent.
Qualified leads are converted into two outputs: a human-readable Slack summary for quick review and a structured, CRM-ready Notion record for tracking and follow-ups. Short-term conversation memory is maintained to improve relevance across follow-up queries. Built-in error handling ensures failures are reported immediately.
⚠️ Deployment Disclaimer
 This template can only be used on self-hosted n8n installations.
 It relies on external MCP tools and custom AI orchestration not supported on n8n Cloud.
