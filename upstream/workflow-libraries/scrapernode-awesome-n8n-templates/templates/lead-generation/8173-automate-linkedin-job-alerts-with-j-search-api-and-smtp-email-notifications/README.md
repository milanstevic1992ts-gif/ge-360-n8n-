## Description

## **Automate LinkedIn Job Alerts with Google Sheets, J-Search (RapidAPI), and SMTP**

## **Description**
Fetch LinkedIn-style job listings from the J-Search API using predefined parameters, then deliver a professional HTML job alert digest to your inbox via SMTP. _Get actionable “Apply Now” links in your email—no manual searching required._ ✉️💼

## **What This Template Does**
- **Manual Trigger:** Initiates the workflow on demand.  
- **Set Preferences:** Captures job search parameters (role, date, page count, country, language) from a Set node.  
- **Job Listing Extraction:** Uses HTTP Request to J-Search API with dynamic parameters from the Set node.  
- **Categorizing Job Listings:** Filters and structures job data (job_id, job_title, employment_type, apply_link) via JavaScript Code node.  
- **Drafting HTML for Mail:** Generates a LinkedIn-themed HTML email with job cards and “Apply Now” buttons.  
- **Sending Job Listings via Mail:** Delivers the job alert digest using SMTP, with a dynamic subject line.
