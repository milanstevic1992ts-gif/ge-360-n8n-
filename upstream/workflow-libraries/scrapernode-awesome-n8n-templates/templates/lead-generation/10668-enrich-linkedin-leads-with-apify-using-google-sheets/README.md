# 🎣 Enrich LinkedIn leads with Apify using Google Sheets

> ⚡ **241 views** · 🎣 [Lead Generation & Enrichment](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

- The results are then stored in a new Google Sheet

- Create a Google sheet, rename the sheet "profiles" and add all the LinkedIn URLs you want to enrich (one url per row)


In this Workflow:
- Open the "Set google sheet URL & orginial sheet name" and replace the example Google sheet URL, and the name of the sheet where your LinkedIn URLs are
