> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## AI-Powered Top GitHub Talent Sourcing (by Language & Location) to Google Sheet

### This n8n template is a powerful talent sourcing engine that finds, analyzes, and scores GitHub contributors using a custom AI formula.

This workflow is ideal for technical recruiters, hiring managers, and team leads who want to build a pipeline of qualified candidates based on specific technical skills and location.

---
### **Self-Hosted Only** 
This Workflow uses a community contribution and is designed and tested for **self-hosted n8n instances** only.

---
### How it works
* The workflow runs on a **Schedule Trigger** (e.g., hourly) to constantly find new candidates.
* A **BrowserAct** node ("Run a workflow task") initiates a scraping job on GitHub based on your criteria (e.g., "Python" developers in "Berlin").
* A second **BrowserAct** node ("Get details") waits for the scraping to complete. If the job fails, a **Slack** alert is sent.
* A **Code** node processes the raw scraped data, splitting the list of developers into individual items.
* An **AI Agent**, powered by **Google Gemini**, analyzes each profile. It scores their resume/summary and calculates a final weighted `FinalScore` based on their followers, repositories, and resume quality.
* The structured and scored candidate data is then saved to a **Google Sheet**, using the "Name" column to prevent duplicates.
* A final **Slack** message is sent to notify you that the GitHub contributors list has been successfully updated.

---
### Requirements
* **BrowserAct** API account for web scraping
* **BrowserAct** "**Source Top GitHub Contributors by Language & Location**" Template
