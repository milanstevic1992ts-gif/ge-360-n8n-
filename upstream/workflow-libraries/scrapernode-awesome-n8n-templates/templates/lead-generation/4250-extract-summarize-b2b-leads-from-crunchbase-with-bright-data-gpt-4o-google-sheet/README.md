## Description

### Who this is for
The Crunchbase B2B Lead Discovery Pipeline is designed for sales teams, B2B marketers, business analysts, and data operations teams who need a reliable way to extract, structure, and summarize company information from Crunchbase to fuel lead generation and market intelligence.

This workflow is ideal for:

1. **Sales Development Reps (SDRs)** - Needing structured leads from Crunchbase

2. **Marketing Analysts** - Generating segmented outreach lists

3. **Growth Teams** - Identifying trending B2B startups

4. **RevOps Teams** - Automating company research pipelines

5. **Data Teams** - Consolidating insights into Google Sheets for dashboards

### What problem is this workflow solving?

Manual extraction of company data from Crunchbase is time-consuming, inconsistent, and often lacks the contextual summary required for sales enablement or growth targeting. 

This workflow automates the extraction, transformation, summarization, and delivery of Crunchbase company data into structured formats, making it instantly usable for B2B targeting and analysis.

It solves:

- The difficulty of scaling lead discovery from Crunchbase

- The need to summarize raw textual content for quick insights

- The lack of integration between web scraping, LLM processing, and storage

### What this workflow does
- **Markdown to Textual Data Extractor**: Takes raw scraped markdown from Crunchbase and converts it into readable plain text using a basic LLM chain

- **Structured Data Extraction**: Applies a parsing model (OpenAI) to extract structured fields such as company name, funding rounds, industry tags, location, and founding year

- **Summarization Chain**: Generates an executive summary from the raw Crunchbase text using a summarization prompt template

- **Send to Google Sheets**: Adds the structured data and summary into a Google Sheet for team access and further processing

- **Persist to Disk**: Saves both raw and structured data files locally for archiving or further use

- **Webhook Notification**: Sends a structured payload to a webhook endpoint (e.g., Slack, CRM, internal tools) with lead insights
