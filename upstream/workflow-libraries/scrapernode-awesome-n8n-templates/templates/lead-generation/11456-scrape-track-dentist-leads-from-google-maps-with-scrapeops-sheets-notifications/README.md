## Description

## Overview
This n8n template automates the generation of local business leads by scraping Google Maps. It goes beyond basic search results by visiting individual business pages to extract detailed contact information, reviews, and attributes (like LGBTQ+ friendly status). It includes built-in deduplication against a Google Sheet to ensure you only receive alerts for *new* leads.

## Who is this for?
- **Marketing Agencies**: Finding local clients for services.
- **Sales Teams**: Building lists of prospects in specific cities.
- **Recruiters**: Finding businesses in specific niches.
- **Researchers**: Gathering data on local business landscapes.

## What problems it solves
- **Manual Data Entry**: Eliminates the need to copy-paste business details from Maps.
- **Duplicate Leads**: Automatically checks against your database to prevent duplicate entries.
- **Incomplete Data**: Performs a "deep scrape" to get data often missing from list views (websites, full phone numbers, reviews).
- **Delayed Action**: Sends instant alerts via Gmail and Slack so you can act on new leads immediately.

## How it works
1. **Input**: Takes a city name via a form (or can be scheduled).
2. **Search**: Uses **ScrapeOps** to search Google Maps for your target keyword (e.g., "Dentist").
3. **Deep Extraction**: Visits each business profile to scrape phone numbers, websites, ratings, and reviews.
4. **Validation**: Compares found businesses with your existing Google Sheet database.
5. **Action**: Saves new leads to the sheet and notifies you via Gmail and Slack.

## Set up steps (~ 10-15 minutes)
1. **ScrapeOps Account**: Register for a free API key at [ScrapeOps](https://scrapeops.io/app/register/n8n).
2. **Google Sheet**: 
   - Create a new Google Sheet.
   - Add these headers: `businessName`, `phone`, `website`, `rating`, `totalReviews`, `address`, `city`, `category`, `mapUrl`, `status`, `checkedAt`, `lgbtqFriendly`, `review1`, `review2`, `review3`.
   - Or duplicate this [Template Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HYO6pw9PigmNKzrnmE9s9JcNVSvZAcIHGF1ZJQ9kfks/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
3. **Configure Nodes**:
   - **Set Google Maps Configuration**: Set your `keyword` (e.g., "dentist", "plumber").
   - **Google Sheets Nodes**: Connect your account and select the sheet you created.
   - **Gmail & Slack Nodes**: Update with your email address and Slack channel.
