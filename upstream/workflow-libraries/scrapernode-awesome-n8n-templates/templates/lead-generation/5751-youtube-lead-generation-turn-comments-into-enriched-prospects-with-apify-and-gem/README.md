# Automated YouTube Leads: Turn Comments into Enriched Prospects

## Workflow Overview

This cutting-edge n8n workflow is a powerful automation tool designed to revolutionize how businesses and marketers identify and qualify leads directly from YouTube video comments. By leveraging specialized Apify Actors and an intelligent AI agent, this workflow seamlessly transforms raw comment data into comprehensive lead profiles, saving valuable time and resources.

This workflow automatically:

  * **Discovers & Scrapes Comments:**

      * Monitors a Google Sheet for new YouTube video URLs.
      * Automatically extracts all comments from specified YouTube videos using a dedicated Apify Actor.
      * Marks videos as "scrapped" to avoid reprocessing.

  * **Intelligent Lead Enrichment:**

      * Retrieves unprocessed comments from Google Sheets.
      * Activates an advanced AI agent (powered by OpenRouter's cutting-edge models) to research comment authors.
      * Utilizes Google Search (via Serper API) and specialized Apify scrapers (for website content and Instagram profiles) to find publicly available information like social media links, bios, and potential contact details.
      * Generates concise descriptions for each lead based on gathered data.

  * **Organized Data Storage:**

      * Creates new entries in a dedicated Google Sheet for each new lead.
      * Updates lead profiles with all discovered enriched data (email, social media, short bio, etc.).
      * Marks comments as "processed" once their authors have been researched and enriched.
