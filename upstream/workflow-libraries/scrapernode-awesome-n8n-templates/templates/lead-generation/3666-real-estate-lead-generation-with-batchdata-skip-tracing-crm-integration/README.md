## Description

How It Works
- 
This workflow automates the entire property lead generation process in a few simple steps:

1. Property Search: Connects to BatchData's Property Search API with customizable parameters (location, property type, value range, equity percentage, etc.)
2. Lead Filtering & Scoring: Processes results to identify the most promising leads based on criteria like absentee ownership, years owned, equity percentage, and tax status. Each property receives a lead score to prioritize follow-up.
3. Skip Tracing: Automatically retrieves owner contact information (phone, email, mailing address) for each qualified property.
4. Data Formatting: Structures all property and owner data into a clean, organized format ready for your systems.
5. Multi-Channel Output:
- Generates an Excel spreadsheet with all lead details
- Pushes leads directly to your CRM (configurable for HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)
- Sends a summary email with the spreadsheet attached



The workflow can run on a daily schedule or be triggered manually as needed. All parameters are easily configurable through dedicated nodes, requiring no coding knowledge.

Who's It For
-
This workflow is perfect for:

- Real Estate Investors looking to find off-market properties with motivated sellers
- Real Estate Agents who want to generate listing leads from distressed or high-equity properties
- Investment Companies that need regular lead flow for acquisitions
- Real Estate Marketers who run targeted campaigns to property owners
- Wholesalers seeking to build a pipeline of potential deals
- Property Service Providers (roof repair, renovation contractors, etc.) who target specific property types

Anyone who needs reliable, consistent lead generation for real estate without the manual work of searching, filtering, and organizing property data will benefit from this automation.
