> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

# Automating LinkedIn Enrichment and ICP Scoring

## Use Case

This automation enriches a person’s data using LinkedIn and calculates an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) score based on their professional presence. It is particularly useful for lead qualification, contact research, and targeted outreach.

## What This Automation Does

The automation processes the following input parameters:

- **Person Name**: Full name of the individual.
- **Work Email**: Business email address to validate corporate identity.
- **Airtop Profile (connected to Linkedin)**: A [LinkedIn-authenticated Airtop Profile](https://portal.airtop.ai/browser-profiles) for enrichment.

## How It Works

1. **Email Filtering**: Checks if the email is corporate (excludes free and personal domains).
2. **LinkedIn Profile Discovery**: Searches and verifies the correct LinkedIn URL using Airtop.
3. **Data Enrichment**: Extracts professional details from the LinkedIn profile.
4. **ICP Scoring**: Calculates an ICP score based on extracted data and profile context.
5. **Merge Outputs**: Consolidates enriched profile data and ICP results into a single output.

## Setup Requirements

1. [Airtop API Key](https://portal.airtop.ai/api-keys)
2. An [Airtop Profile](https://portal.airtop.ai/browser-profiles) authenticated on LinkedIn.

## Next Steps

- **Combine with CRM Integration**: Push enriched and scored data into CRMs like HubSpot or Salesforce.
- **Batch Processing**: Automate for lists of leads using Airtop + n8n or Airtop SDK.
- **Scoring Customization**: Adjust scoring logic to reflect your ideal customer attributes more precisely.
