> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Heads up — if this workflow's Instagram scraping breaks (it happens whenever Meta updates their frontend), [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/instagram) is a community node that handles [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/profiles), [posts](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/posts), [reels](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/reels), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/comments) without any HTML parsing.

## Description

![Instagram user enrichment, KlickTipp subscription and sending DMs.png](fileId:3104)

## **Community Node Disclaimer**
This workflow uses **KlickTipp community nodes**, available for **self-hosted n8n instances only**.

---

## **Who’s it for**
Digital marketers, social media managers, and coaches who engage leads through **Instagram DMs** and want to **automate personalized outreach, lead enrichment, and segmentation** in KlickTipp — without manual follow-ups or data entry.

---

## **How it works**
This workflow creates a **complete Instagram-to-email enrichment loop** — starting with personalized **DM outreach**, capturing responses via **JotForm**, enriching profile data, and syncing everything with **KlickTipp**.

When a workflow trigger or campaign action occurs, it:
1. Sends a **personalized Instagram DM** inviting the user to fill out a JotForm.  
2. Listens for **form submissions** in real time.  
3. Retrieves the lead’s **Instagram profile data** via the **Facebook Graph API**.  
4. Matches the username to the **Instagram DM ID** in a **Google Sheet**.  
5. Generates **AI-powered marketing insights** using **OpenAI**.  
6. Subscribes or updates the lead in **KlickTipp**, mapping enriched fields and tags.  

The result: every DM-initiated lead is captured, analyzed, and segmented — ready for intelligent follow-ups and personalized campaigns.

---

## **How to set up**
1. Connect accounts for KlickTipp, JotForm, Google Sheets, Facebook Graph API, and OpenAI.  
2. Set up a KlickTipp tag or campaign trigger to initiate the **DM sending**.  
3. Create KlickTipp fields for Instagram data (e.g., Bio, Follower count, Insights).  
4. Add tags: `Instagram | Outreach`, `Instagram | Enrichment`, `Instagram | Username found`.  
5. Test a sample flow: send a DM → fill the JotForm → verify data enrichment in KlickTipp.  

💡 *Pro Tip:* Personalize the DM message template and test both personal and business accounts to ensure optimal engagement and AI insight quality.
