> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

Automatically research new leads in your target area, structure the results with AI, and append them into Google Sheets — all orchestrated in n8n.

---

## ✅ What this template does
- Uses **Perplexity** to research businesses (coffee shops in this example) with company name + email  
- Cleans and structures the output into proper JSON using **OpenAI**  
- Appends the new leads directly into **Google Sheets**, skipping duplicates  

&gt; **Trigger:** Manual — “Start Workflow”

---

## 👤 Who’s it for
- **Sales & marketing teams** who need to prospect local businesses  
- **Agencies** running outreach campaigns  
- **Freelancers** and consultants looking to automate lead research  

---

## ⚙️ How it works
1. **Set Location** → define your target area (e.g., *Hershey PA*)  
2. **Get Current Leads** → pull existing data from your Google Sheet to avoid duplicates  
3. **Research Leads** → query Perplexity for 20 businesses, excluding already-scraped ones  
4. **Write JSON** → OpenAI converts Perplexity output into structured Company/Email arrays  
5. **Split & Merge** → align Companies with Emails row-by-row  
6. **Send Leads to Google Sheets** → append or update leads in your sheet
