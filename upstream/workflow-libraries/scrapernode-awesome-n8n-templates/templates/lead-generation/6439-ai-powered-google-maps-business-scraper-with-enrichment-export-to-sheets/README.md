### 🧠 Workflow Summary

1. **Trigger**
   The automation starts via schedule (every hour).

2. **Read Queries from Google Sheet**
   Loads unprocessed keywords from a Google Sheet tab named `keywords`.

3. **Loop Through Keywords**
   Each keyword is used to search Google Maps for relevant businesses.

4. **Extract URLs**
   JavaScript parses HTML to find all external website URLs from the search results.

5. **Clean URLs**
   Filters out irrelevant domains (e.g., Google-owned, example.com, etc.), and removes duplicates.

6. **Loop Through URLs**
   For each URL:

   * Checks if it already exists in the Google Sheet (to prevent duplication).
   * Calls the **APIFY Actor** to extract full business data.
   * Optionally uses **AI Agent (Gemini)** to provide detailed insight on the business, including:

     * Services, About, Market Position, Weaknesses, AI suggestions, etc.
   * Converts the AI result (text) to a structured JSON object.

7. **Save to Google Sheet**
   Adds all extracted and AI-enriched business information to a separate tab (`Sheet1`).

8. **Mark Queries as Processed**
   Updates the original row in `keywords` to avoid reprocessing.
