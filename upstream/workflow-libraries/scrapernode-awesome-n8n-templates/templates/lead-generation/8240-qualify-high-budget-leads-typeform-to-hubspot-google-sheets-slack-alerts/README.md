## Description

## How it works
This workflow captures new leads from Typeform, instantly checks if their budget is above $5,000, and prioritizes them for faster sales follow-up. High-budget leads are enriched in HubSpot as contacts with detailed properties, and a priority task is created for the sales team. Leads are then routed based on their source (Facebook or SurveyMonkey), logged into Google Sheets for marketing or campaign tracking, and finally, a Slack notification is sent to alert the team in real time.

## Step-by-step

**Capture & Qualify Leads**

- The workflow triggers on new Typeform submissions.

- It evaluates the budget field to identify high-priority leads (&gt;$5,000).

**CRM Enrichment**

- High-priority leads are automatically created or updated as contacts in HubSpot.

- A priority follow-up task is logged in HubSpot with the lead’s budget details.

**Source-Based Routing**

- If the lead comes from Facebook or SurveyMonkey, their details are logged in a Google Sheet.

- This ensures marketing and campaign teams can analyze and track leads separately.

**Team Notifications**

- Once logged, the workflow sends a Slack message to the sales/marketing channel.

- The message includes the lead’s name, email, phone, budget, and source, ensuring instant visibility for follow-up.

## Why use this?

- Automatically qualifies high-value leads based on budget.

- Syncs lead details seamlessly with HubSpot CRM.

- Routes leads by source for better campaign tracking.

- Keeps sales and marketing teams aligned with real-time Slack alerts.

- Cuts down manual effort, ensuring faster response times and higher conversion rates.
