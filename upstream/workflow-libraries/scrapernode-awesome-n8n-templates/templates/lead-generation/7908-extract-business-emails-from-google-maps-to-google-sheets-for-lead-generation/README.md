> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

## How it Works

This workflow builds a **free lead generation system** that scrapes emails from Google Maps listings and exports them directly into **Google Sheets**. It’s built in **n8n** using HTTP requests and JavaScript—no paid APIs required.

Here’s what it does at a high level:

* 🔎 Scrapes business listings from Google Maps based on search queries (e.g., “Miami lawyers”)
* 🌐 Extracts real business website URLs using regex filtering
* 📧 Finds and validates email addresses from each website
* 🧹 Cleans data by removing duplicates and invalid entries
* 📊 Exports clean email lists into Google Sheets automatically

---

## Set Up Steps

* Estimated setup time: **1–2 hours**
* Create a Google Sheet with two tabs:

  * `searches` → add your search queries (e.g., “Calgary dentist”)
  * `emails` → results will be stored here automatically
* Connect Google Sheets credentials in n8n
* Update your Google Sheet document ID in the workflow nodes
* Test with small batches first, then scale up
