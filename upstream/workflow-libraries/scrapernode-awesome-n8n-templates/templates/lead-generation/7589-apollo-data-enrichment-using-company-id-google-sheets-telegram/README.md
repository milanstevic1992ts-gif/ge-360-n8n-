It removes the manual copy-paste scavenger hunt and turns hours of research into minutes like hiring a tireless intern who never asks for coffee.

## 💡 Why Use Apollo Data Enrichment Based Using Company Id?
- **Save time:** Automates enrichment of contacts from company IDs so you stop spending hours looking up emails and phone numbers.  
- **Solve noisy data:** Only queries relevant titles and email status filters so your outbound team sees fewer dead leads.  
- **Improve outcomes:** Ensures enriched, outreach ready contacts (emails/phones) land in your sheet. Faster follow-up, higher reply rates.  
- **Competitive edge:** Targets granular procurement roles (manager/head/lead/director) and marks processed companies to avoid duplicate work  makes your outreach becomes smarter and cleaner.

## ⚡ Perfect For
- **Outbound/BDR teams:** who need contacts ready for outreach  
- **Data ops / Growth teams:** who maintain lead lists and enrichment pipelines

## 🔧 How It Works
- **⏱ Trigger:** Scheduled trigger “Run Every X Minutes” that periodically picks unprocessed companies.  
- **📎 Process:** Reads companies from the Google Sheet, fetches the Apollo Company ID, builds title/seniority/email-status filters, calls Apollo `mixed_people/search` and then `people/match` for full contact details.  
- **🤖 Smart Logic:** Title Converter separates seniority from core titles, the Build Search Filters code node constructs precise Apollo query strings, and an If node branches when no people are found.  
- **💌 Output:** Writes enriched contacts into the *Purchasing / Procurement Roles* Google Sheet, updates *Leadsfeeder* to mark companies as processed, accepts phone updates via webhook and notifies via Telegram.

## 🛠️ Level Up Ideas
- Push enriched contacts directly into your CRM (HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce) to start sequences automatically

- Respect rate limits and add exponential backoff + request batching for large company lists
