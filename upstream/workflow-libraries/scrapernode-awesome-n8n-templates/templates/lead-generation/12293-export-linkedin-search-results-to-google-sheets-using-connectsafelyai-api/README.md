# 🎣 Export LinkedIn search results to Google Sheets using ConnectSafely.ai API

> ⚡ **89 views** · 🎣 [Lead Generation & Enrichment](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

## Who's it for

This workflow is built for sales professionals, recruiters, founders, and growth marketers who need to build targeted prospect lists from LinkedIn without risking their accounts. Perfect for anyone who wants to find decision-makers, build lead lists, or research target audiences at scale.

If you're running outbound campaigns, building ABM lists, sourcing candidates, or doing competitive research, this automation handles LinkedIn searches and exports results directly to your Google Sheet—no browser cookies, no session hijacking, no ban risk.

## How it works

The workflow automates LinkedIn people searches by leveraging ConnectSafely.ai's compliant API, then exports structured results to Google Sheets or JSON files.

**The process flow:**

1. Define your search parameters (keywords, location, job title, result limit)
2. Execute the search via ConnectSafely.ai API
3. Process and normalize the response data
4. Export to Google Sheets for CRM import or further automation
5. Optionally save as JSON file for data backup or processing

No LinkedIn cookies required. No browser automation. Platform-compliant searches that won't get your account restricted.
