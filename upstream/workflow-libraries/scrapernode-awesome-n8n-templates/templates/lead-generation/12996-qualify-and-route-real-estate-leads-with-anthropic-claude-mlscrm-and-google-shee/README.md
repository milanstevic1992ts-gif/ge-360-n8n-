## Description

## How It Works
This workflow automates real estate lead qualification and routing by enriching leads from multiple sources with AI-powered analysis and directing them to appropriate sales agents based on priority. Designed for real estate brokers, sales managers, and lead generation teams, it solves the critical challenge of quickly identifying high-value prospects from high-volume lead streams while ensuring timely agent follow-up. The system triggers on schedule, fetches leads simultaneously from MLS portals and CRM/email sources, aggregates all leads into unified dataset, splits leads for parallel processing, then deploys AI agents using Anthropic's Claude to analyze lead quality, buying intent, budget capacity, and urgency. Based on enrichment scores, leads are routed to best-fit agents by priority tier, with engagement tracking logged to Google Sheets for performance monitoring and optimization.
