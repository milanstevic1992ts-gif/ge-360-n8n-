## Description

# Enrich and score Japanese company leads with government APIs, web scraping, and Gemini AI

## What this workflow does

This workflow automates B2B lead research for Japanese companies. Submit a company name through a web form, and the workflow queries two free Japanese government APIs for corporate registry and business data, checks Google Maps for reputation, scrapes the company website for contact details and tech stack, and uses Gemini AI to score the lead and write a personalized outreach message in Japanese. Results are saved to Google Sheets, and high-scoring leads trigger a Slack alert.

## How it works

1. **Lead input form** — A sales rep submits a company name along with industry, prefecture, priority, and notes
2. **National Tax Agency API** — Retrieves the official corporate number, registered name, address, and entity type using the free 法人番号 API
3. **gBizINFO API** — Enriches the lead with employee count, capital, establishment date, representative, subsidies, certifications, patents, and business summary using the free Ministry of Economy API
4. **Google Maps Places API** — Fetches the company's star rating, review count, and business status for reputation assessment
5. **Website scraping** — Fetches the company homepage and extracts email addresses, Japanese phone numbers, tech stack (11 technologies including AWS, AI/ML, and DX), hiring signals, and social media links
6. **AI lead scoring** — Gemini AI analyzes all collected data and produces a score from 0 to 100, three actionable insights, a personalized outreach message in Japanese, and a recommended next action
7. **Google Sheets** — Saves 30+ data fields per lead for pipeline tracking and reporting
8. **Slack alert** — Leads scoring 75 or higher trigger an instant notification with the full intelligence report
