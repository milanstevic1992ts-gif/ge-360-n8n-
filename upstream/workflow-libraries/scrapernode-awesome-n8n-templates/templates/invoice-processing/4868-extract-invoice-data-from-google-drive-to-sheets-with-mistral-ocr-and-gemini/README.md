If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

Extract data from any PDF or image invoice dropped in Google Drive directly into Google Sheets – powered by AI OCR. Free, fully modifiable n8n workflow. Optional add-ons for pro features.

🚀 What this template does

Stop typing invoice data by hand. Drop a PDF or phone-snapshot into your Invoices Inbox folder in Google Drive and this n8n workflow will:





Auto-OCR the document with the Mistral OCR API



Match any fields you list in Row 1 of your Google Sheet (totally schema-agnostic)



Append a clean, structured row – every time

Works with both PDFs and images, in any language supported by Mistral.

Template JSON included, ready to import into self-hosted or n8n Cloud

👀 Who’s this for?





Freelancers & agencies processing client invoices



Small finance teams on Google Workspace



Anyone self-hosting n8n who wants an AI OCR flow without glue-code

No coding skills required – but flow tweaking is possible for power users.
