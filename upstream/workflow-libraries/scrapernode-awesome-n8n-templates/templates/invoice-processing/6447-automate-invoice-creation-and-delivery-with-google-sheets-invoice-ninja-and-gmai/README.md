## Description

# ⚙️ How It Works

This workflow automates the repetitive task of invoicing, turning a manual process into an efficient, hands-free operation.

#### ✅ Trigger
The workflow is automatically activated when a new row is **added or updated** in your Google Sheet with the status **`Ready for Invoice`**.

#### 🧾 Create Invoice
The workflow sends project data to your invoicing service (e.g., Invoice Ninja) using an **HTTP Request** node to generate a professional invoice.

#### 📧 Send Email
The generated invoice is attached to an email and sent to the client using the **Gmail node**.

#### 📝 Update Status
Finally, the workflow updates the `Status` field in Google Sheet to **`Invoiced`**, marking the process complete and recorded.
