## Description

## **Who is this for?**

This workflow is ideal for:

* **Finance teams** that need to process incoming invoices faster with minimal errors
* **Small to mid-sized businesses** that want to automate invoice intake, review, and storage
* **Operations managers** who require approval workflows and centralized record-keeping

## **What problem is this workflow solving?**

Manually processing invoices is time-consuming, error-prone, and often lacks structure. This workflow solves those challenges by:

* **Automating the intake of invoices** from multiple sources (email, Google Drive, web form)
* **Extracting invoice data using AI**, eliminating manual data entry
* **Implementing an email-based approval system** to add human oversight
* **Automatically storing approved invoice data** in Google Sheets for easy access and reporting
* **Notifying stakeholders** when invoices are approved or rejected

## **What this workflow does**

This end-to-end invoice processing workflow includes:

1. **Three invoice input methods**: Google Drive folder monitor, Gmail attachments, and web form uploads
2. **PDF to text extraction** for each input method using native PDF parsing
3. **AI-powered invoice analysis** with GPT-4 to extract structured fields such as vendor, total, and due date
4. **Dynamic categorization** of invoice type (e.g., Travel, Software, Utilities) via AI
5. **Email-based approval workflow** with embedded forms to collect decisions and notes
6. **Automated Google Sheets logging** of all invoice data, approval status, and reviewer feedback
7. **Rejection notifications** sent automatically to your finance team for transparency and follow-up

## **Setup**

1. **Copy the Google Sheet template** here:  
👉 [PDF Invoice Parser with Approval Workflow – Google Sheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ueJfN5dFTXY3_AdvnYUL5_RjV9YwSFvbxwA_ivtqnJk/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
2. **Connect your Google Drive** account and specify the invoice folder ID  
3. **Set up Gmail** to monitor incoming invoices with PDF attachments  
4. **Enable your form trigger** to accept direct uploads from your internal or external users  
5. **Enter your OpenAI API key** in the AI processing node for data extraction  
6. **Configure Google Sheets** with a target spreadsheet to store invoice data  
7. **Set recipient email addresses** for invoice approvals and rejection notifications  
8. **Test with a sample invoice** to ensure end-to-end flow is working  


## **How to customize this workflow to your needs**

* **Change input sources**: Replace Gmail with Outlook or use Slack uploads instead
* **Add validation steps**: Include regex or keyword checks before AI analysis
* **Customize the AI schema**: Modify the expected JSON structure based on your internal finance system
* **Integrate with accounting tools**: Add Xero, QuickBooks, or custom API nodes to push data
* **Route based on category**: Add conditional logic to handle invoices differently based on vendor or category
* **Multi-level approvals**: Add additional email steps if higher-level signoff is needed
* **Audit logging**: Use database or Google Sheets to maintain a historical log of approvals and rejections
