## Description

## ✅ What problem does this workflow solve?

Accounting teams spend **hours manually entering purchase bills** into accounting systems—copying vendor details, creating items, checking duplicates, and reconciling totals. This workflow removes that manual effort entirely.

With **OCR + AI + QuickBooks integration**, this automation converts uploaded purchase bills into **fully reconciled QuickBooks bills**—accurately, consistently, and without human intervention.

---

## ⚙️ What does this workflow do?

- Accepts **multiple purchase bills** in a single upload
- Extracts structured invoice data using OCR + AI
- Automatically syncs vendors and items with **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**
- Creates missing vendors or items when needed
- Generates clean, validated bills inside QuickBooks
- Prevents duplicate vendors or line items

---

## 🧠 How It Works – Step-by-Step

### 1. 📤 Upload Purchase Bills
- Users upload **one or multiple PDF bills** using an n8n form
- Each bill is automatically split and processed individually

### 2. 🔍 OCR & Invoice Data Extraction
- The workflow extracts text from each PDF
- An AI extraction engine powered by :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} identifies:
  - Invoice number & dates
  - Vendor details
  - Line items (name, quantity, price, amount)
  - Subtotal, tax, and total

### 3. 🔄 Item & Vendor Reconciliation (QuickBooks)
- Fetches **existing items** from QuickBooks
- If an item does not exist:
  - Automatically creates it
- Checks if the vendor exists:
  - Creates a new vendor if missing
- Ensures **zero duplicates** in QuickBooks

### 4. 🧾 Bill Payload Creation
- Builds a clean QuickBooks-compatible bill payload
- Maps:
  - Items
  - Vendor
  - Dates
  - Taxes
  - Totals
- Handles edge cases like missing quantities or unit prices

### 5. 💰 Bill Creation in QuickBooks
- Creates a finalized bill inside QuickBooks
- Each bill is immediately ready for reconciliation and reporting
