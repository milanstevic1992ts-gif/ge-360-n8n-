## Description

### Who is this for?

This workflow is perfect for operations teams, accountants, e-commerce businesses, or finance managers who regularly process digital invoices and need to automate data extraction and record-keeping.

---

### What problem is this workflow solving?

Manually reading invoice PDFs, extracting relevant data, and entering it into spreadsheets is time-consuming and error-prone. This workflow automates that process—watching a Google Drive folder, extracting structured invoice data using Dumpling AI, and saving the results into Google Sheets.

---

### What this workflow does

1. Watches a specific Google Drive folder for new invoices.
2. Downloads the uploaded invoice file.
3. Converts the file into a Base64 format.
4. Sends the file to Dumpling AI’s `extract-document` endpoint with a detailed parsing prompt.
5. Parses Dumpling AI’s JSON response using a Code node.
6. Splits the `items` array into individual rows using the Split Out node.
7. Appends each invoice item to a preformatted Google Sheet along with the full header metadata (order number, PO, addresses, etc.).

### Setup

1. **Google Drive Setup**
   - Create or select a folder in Google Drive and place the folder ID in the trigger node.
   - Make sure your n8n Google Drive credentials are authorized for access.

2. **Google Sheets**
   - Create a Google Sheet with the following headers:
     `Order number`, `Document Date`, `Po_number`, `Sold to name`, `Sold to address`, `Ship to name`, `Ship to address`, `Model`, `Description`, `Quantity`, `Unity price`, `Total price`
   - Paste the Sheet ID and sheet name (`Sheet1`) into the Google Sheets node.

3. **Dumpling AI**
   - Sign up at [Dumpling AI](https://www.dumplingai.com/)
   - Go to your account settings and generate your API key.
   - Paste this key into the HTTP header of the Dumpling AI request node.
   - The endpoint used is: `https://app.dumplingai.com/api/v1/extract-document`

4. **Prompt (already included)**
   - This prompt extracts: order number, document date, PO number, shipping/billing details, and detailed line items (model, quantity, unit price, total).

### How to customize this workflow to your needs

- Adjust the Google Sheet fields to fit your invoice structure.
- Modify the Dumpling AI prompt if your invoices have additional or different data points.
- Add filtering logic if you want to handle different invoice types differently.
- Replace Google Sheets with Airtable or a database if preferred.
- Use a different trigger like an email attachment if invoices come via email.
