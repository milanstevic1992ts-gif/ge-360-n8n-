## Description

Transform college admissions from an overwhelming manual process into an intelligent, efficient, and equitable system that analyzes essays, scores applicants holistically, and identifies top candidates—saving 40+ hours per week while improving decision quality.

## 🎯 What This Workflow Does

Automates comprehensive application review with AI-powered analysis:

1. **📝 Application Intake** - Captures complete college applications via Jotform
2. **📚 AI Essay Analysis** - Deep analysis of personal statements and supplemental essays for:
   - Writing quality, authenticity, and voice
   - AI-generated content detection
   - Specificity and research quality
   - Red flags (plagiarism, inconsistencies, generic writing)
3. **🎯 Holistic Review AI** - Evaluates applicants across five dimensions:
   - Academic strength (GPA, test scores, rigor)
   - Extracurricular profile (leadership, depth, impact)
   - Personal qualities (character, resilience, maturity)
   - Institutional fit (values alignment, contribution potential)
   - Diversity contribution (unique perspectives, experiences)
4. **🚦 Smart Routing** - Automatically categorizes and routes applications:
   - **Strong Admit (85-100)**: Slack alert → Director email → Interview invitation → Fast-track
   - **Committee Review (65-84)**: Detailed analysis → Committee discussion → Human decision
   - **Standard Review (&lt;65)**: Acknowledgment → Human verification → Standard timeline
5. **📊 Comprehensive Analytics** - All applications logged with scores, recommendations, and outcomes
