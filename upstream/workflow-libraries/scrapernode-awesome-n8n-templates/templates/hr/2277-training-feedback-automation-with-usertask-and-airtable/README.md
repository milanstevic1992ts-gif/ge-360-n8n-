> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

### How it works

This workflow operates with an Airtable trigger but can be easily adapted to work with other triggers like webhooks from external applications.

Once feedback data is captured, the workflow evaluates the feedback and directs it to the appropriate channel for action. Tasks are created in Usertask based on the feedback rating, and notifications are sent to relevant parties.

Here’s a brief overview of this n8n workflow template:

- **Airtable Trigger**: Captures new or updated feedback entries from Airtable.
- **Switch Node**: Evaluates the feedback rating and directs the workflow based on the rating.
- **Webhook**: Retrieves the result of a Usertask task.
- **Task Creation**:
  - Creates tasks in Usertask for poor feedback.
  - Creates follow-up tasks for fair to good feedback.
  - Documents positive feedback and posts recognition on LinkedIn for very good to excellent ratings.
- **Notifications**:
  - Sends email notifications to responsible parties for urgent actions.
  - Sends congratulatory emails and posts on LinkedIn for positive feedback.

### To summarize

- **Flexible Integration**: This workflow can be triggered by various methods like Airtable updates or webhooks from other applications.
- **Automated Task Management**: It creates tasks in Usertask based on feedback ratings to ensure timely follow-up.
- **Multichannel Notifications**: Sends notifications via email and LinkedIn to keep stakeholders informed and recognize successes.
