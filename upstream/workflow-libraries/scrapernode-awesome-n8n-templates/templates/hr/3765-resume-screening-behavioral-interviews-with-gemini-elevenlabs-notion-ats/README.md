### Who is this for?

HR teams, recruiters, and talent acquisition professionals

This workflow is ideal for HR teams, recruiters, and talent acquisition professionals looking for a foundational, extensible framework to automate early stage recruiting. Whether you're exploring AI for the first time or scaling automation across your hiring process, this template provides a base for screening, interviewing, and tracking candidates—powered entirely by n8n, Elevenlabs, Notion, and LLM integrations.

### Pre-screen Applicants with AI

### Voice AI that Interviews like a Recruiter

AI Voice agent adapts probing questions based on applicant’s response and intelligently dives deeper into skill and experience to assess answers against a scoring rubric for each question.  

### AI Applicant Insights in Notion

### AI Agent evaluates resume against job description

### Creates ATS record in Notion with assessment and score

Workflow creates the applicant record in the Notion ATS where Recruiters and Hiring Managers see applicants in a filtered view, sorted by AI generated resume score.  Users can automatically advance applicants to the next step in process (AI Conversation interview) with drag and drop functionality. 

### Invites applicant to an Instant AI Interview

Dragging the applicant to AI Interview step in the Notion ATS dashboard triggers Notion automation that sends the applicant an email with a link to the Elevenlabs Conversation AI Agent.  The AI Conversation Agent is provided with instructions on how to conduct the behavior-based interview, including probing questions, for the specific role.

### AI Conversation Agent Behavior Based Interview

The email link resolves to an [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) AI Conversation agent that has been instructed to interview applicants using pre-defined interview questions, scoring rubric, job description, and company profile.  The Elevenlabs agent assesses the applicant on a scale of 1 to 5 for each interview question and provides an overall assessment of the interview based on established evaluation criteria.
