## Description

# GPT-4o Resume Screener with Error Handling - Google Sheets & Drive Pipeline

## How it works

Enterprise-grade resume screening automation built for production environments. This workflow combines intelligent AI analysis with comprehensive error handling to ensure reliable processing of candidate applications. Every potential failure point is monitored with automatic recovery and notification systems.

**Core workflow steps:**
1. **Intelligent Email Processing** - Monitors Gmail with attachment validation and file type detection
2. **Robust File Handling** - Multi-format support with upload verification and extraction validation
3. **Quality-Controlled AI Analysis** - GPT-4o evaluation with output validation and fallback mechanisms
4. **Verified Data Extraction** - Contact and qualification extraction with data integrity checks
5. **Dual Logging System** - Success tracking in main dashboard, error logging in separate audit trail

**Error Recovery Features:**
- Upload failure detection with retry mechanisms
- Text extraction validation with quality thresholds
- AI processing timeout protection and fallback responses
- Data validation before final logging
- Comprehensive error notification and tracking system

## Set up steps
