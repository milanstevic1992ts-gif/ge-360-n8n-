# 👥 Employee time tracking system with GPT-4o reports & Gmail notifications

## Description

### Overview
This workflow acts as an **AI-powered smart time tracker** for employees or personal use.  
It records work sessions via a webhook, logs start/end/break times into n8n Data Tables,  
and uses **OpenAI** to automatically summarize working patterns and send reminders or monthly reports via Gmail.

---

### How It Works
1. **Webhook `/track-time`** → Receives a `POST` request with a `method` (`start`, `break`, or `end`) and duration if applicable.  
2. **Switch Logic** → Directs the request to create or update the appropriate record in your Data Table.  
3. **Data Tables** → Store timestamps, break durations, and worker IDs in a secure local table.  
4. **Schedule Triggers**  
   - **Daily (10:00)** → Checks if today’s shift was not started and sends a reminder.  
   - **Monthly (Day 1, 06:00)** → Compiles last month’s working data and sends an AI report to management.  
5. **OpenAI Analysis**  
   - Summarizes working hours and productivity trends.  
   - Detects missed clock-ins or irregular patterns.  
6. **Gmail Integration** → Sends formatted daily or monthly reports to both employees and supervisors.
