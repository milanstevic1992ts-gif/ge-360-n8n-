> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

This automation intelligently connects candidate profiles to job opportunities. It takes an intake form with a short summary, resume link, and optional LinkedIn profile, then enriches the data using Decodo and Gemini. The workflow analyzes skills, experience, and role relevance, ranks top matches, and emails a polished HTML report directly to your inbox—saving hours of manual review and matching effort.
