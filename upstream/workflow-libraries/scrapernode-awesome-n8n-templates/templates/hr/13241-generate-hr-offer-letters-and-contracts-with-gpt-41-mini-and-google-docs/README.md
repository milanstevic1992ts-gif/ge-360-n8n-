## Description

## Description

An intelligent AI-powered workflow that automates HR document creation for new hires. Upload candidate documents via form, and the system extracts details, auto-calculates joining dates, fills professional templates using GPT-4, and saves the final Offer Letter or Employment Contract directly to Google Docs—all in seconds.

---

## What this workflow does

This automation handles your complete HR onboarding document pipeline:

- **Form-based submission:** HR fills a simple form with candidate's Identity card, Resume, Job Role, Salary, and document type selection
- **Smart data extraction:** Automatically extracts candidate name from uploaded Resume PDF and calculates joining date (1st of next month)
- **Template selection:** Routes to Offer Letter or Employment Contract template based on HR's selection
- **AI-powered filling:** Uses OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini to intelligently fill all placeholders while preserving exact formatting, line breaks, and emojis
- **Google Docs output:** Saves the final professional document directly to Google Docs, ready to send to the candidate

---

## Setup requirements

**Tools you'll need:**

- Active n8n instance (self-hosted or n8n Cloud)
- Google Docs with OAuth access
- OpenAI API key (GPT-4.1-mini access)
- PDF documents: Candidate's Identity card and Resume

**Estimated setup time:** 15–20 minutes

---

## Step-by-step setup

### 1. Connect Google Docs
- In n8n: **Credentials → Add credential → Google Docs OAuth2 API**
- Complete OAuth authentication
- Open **"Save Document to Google Docs"** node
- Create a new Google Doc or use an existing template document
- Copy the document URL and paste it in the **documentURL** field

### 2. Add OpenAI API credentials
- Get API key: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- In n8n: **Credentials → Add credential → OpenAI API**
- Paste your API key
- Open **"OpenAI GPT-4.1 Mini Model"** node
- Select your OpenAI credential
- Ensure model is set to **gpt-4.1-mini**

### 3. Customize document templates
The workflow includes two pre-built templates. You can customize them:

**Offer Letter Template:**
- Open **"Load Offer Letter Template"** node
- Edit the `template_offer` value
- Available placeholders: `[Candidate Name]`, `[Job Role]`, `[Department/Team Name]`, `[Company Name]`, `[Joining Date]`, `[Salary Details]`, `[Work Location]`, `[Reporting Manager/Team Lead]`, `[Probation Period]`

**Employment Contract Template:**
- Open **"Load Contract Template"** node
- Edit the `template_contract` value
- Uses the same placeholders with additional terms and conditions sections

**Important:** Keep all placeholders in square brackets `[Placeholder Name]` exactly as shown. The AI will replace them automatically.

### 4. Configure form fields (optional)
- Open **"Receive Candidate Details via Form"** node
- Default fields: Identity card (file), Resume (file), Job Role (text), Salary Details (number), Type (dropdown)
- Add optional fields if needed: Department Name, Work Location, Reporting Manager, Probation Period
- Copy the **Form URL** from the node settings
- Share this URL with your HR team

### 5. Test the workflow
- Open the **Form URL** in your browser
- Upload sample Identity card and Resume PDFs
- Fill Job Role: "Software Developer"
- Enter Salary Details: 50000
- Select Type: "Offer Letter"
- Submit the form
- Check your Google Docs—the filled document should appear automatically
- Verify all placeholders are replaced correctly

### 6. Activate the workflow
- Toggle the workflow to **Active** at the top
- The form will now accept submissions 24/7
- Each submission generates a new document in Google Docs

---

## How it works

### 1. Form submission
HR opens the form link and uploads candidate documents (Identity card + Resume as PDFs), enters job details, and selects document type (Offer Letter or Contract).

### 2. Document processing
The workflow splits uploaded files into separate items and auto-generates two dates:
- **Form Date:** Current submission date
- **Joining Date:** Automatically set to the 1st of next month

### 3. Text extraction
Extracts text from both PDF documents using n8n's built-in Extract From File node. The candidate's name is typically pulled from the Resume.

### 4. Data aggregation
Combines extracted text from both documents into a single data item for processing.

### 5. Template routing
Checks the selected document type:
- If "Offer Letter" → loads the Offer Letter template
- If "Contract" → loads the Employment Contract template

### 6. AI template filling
The AI Agent receives:
- The selected template with placeholders
- All form data (Job Role, Salary, etc.)
- Extracted candidate name from Resume
- Auto-calculated joining date

GPT-4.1-mini fills every placeholder with actual data while strictly preserving:
- Line breaks and paragraph spacing
- Emojis and special characters
- Bold/italic formatting markers
- Email, phone, and web links

### 7. Google Docs save
The final filled document is inserted into your Google Docs document. Each submission appends a new document, so you can maintain a running archive or clear the doc periodically.

## Troubleshooting

### Google Docs not saving
- **Re-authenticate OAuth credentials:** Go to Credentials → Google Docs OAuth2 API → Reconnect
- **Check document URL:** Ensure the documentURL field contains a valid Google Docs link (not a Sheets link)
- **Verify permissions:** Make sure the connected Google account has edit access to the document

### Candidate name not extracting correctly
- **Resume format issue:** The workflow expects candidate name in the Resume PDF text. If your Resume format is unusual, you may need to adjust the extraction logic.
- **Check extraction node:** Open "Extract Text from Identity card and Resume" node → Test execution → Verify text output
- **Manual override:** Add a "Candidate Name" field to the form if automatic extraction fails

### AI not filling placeholders
- **Check API key:** Verify OpenAI API key is active and has credits at https://platform.openai.com/usage
- **Placeholder mismatch:** Ensure template placeholders exactly match the format `[Placeholder Name]` with square brackets
- **Test AI node:** Click "Fill Template with AI" → Execute node → Check output for errors

### Joining date incorrect
- **Timezone issue:** The date calculation uses server timezone. Verify your n8n instance timezone settings.
- **Custom date needed:** If you want a different joining date logic (e.g., 15 days from submission), edit the "Split Documents and Calculate Dates" code node.

### Form not accepting file uploads
- **File size limit:** Default n8n form limit is 16MB. Compress PDFs if larger.
- **File type validation:** Ensure uploaded files are PDFs, not images or other formats.
- **Browser issue:** Try a different browser (Chrome recommended for file uploads).

**Remote-first companies:** Enable distributed HR teams to generate documents without shared drives or email chains. Single form link, instant output.

**Consulting firms:** Create client-specific employment contracts with custom templates. Switch between contract types based on project requirements.

## Expected results

- **Time savings:** 15-20 minutes saved per document (from 20 min manual → 2 min automated)
- **Output quality:** Professional, error-free documents with consistent formatting every time
- **Scalability:** Process 50+ candidates per week without additional HR headcount
- **Error reduction:** Eliminate typos and placeholder mistakes common in manual copy-paste workflows

## Workflow customization

### Add more form fields
Open "Receive Candidate Details via Form" node and add custom fields:
- Department Name (dropdown with your teams)
- Work Location (dropdown: Remote, Office, Hybrid)
- Reporting Manager (text input)
- Probation Period (number input)
- Start Date (date picker for custom joining dates)

These values automatically populate in templates if placeholders are added.

### Create additional templates
Duplicate one of the "Load Template" nodes and create:
- Internship Offer Letters
- Part-time Contract
- Freelancer Agreement
- Probation Extension Letter

Add a corresponding option in the form Type dropdown.

### Send documents via email
Add an **Email** node after "Save Document to Google Docs":
- Attach the Google Docs link
- Send to candidate email (add email field to form)
- CC HR manager automatically

### Multi-language support
Create template variations in different languages. Add a "Language" dropdown to the form and route to appropriate template.
