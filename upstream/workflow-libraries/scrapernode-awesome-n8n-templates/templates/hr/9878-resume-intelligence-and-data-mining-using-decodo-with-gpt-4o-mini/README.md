## Description

## 1. Who this is for

This workflow is specifically designed for

* Recruiters, HR analytics teams, and data-driven talent acquisition professionals seeking deeper insights from candidate resume.
* Valuable for HR tech developers, ATS/CRM engineers, and AI-driven recruitment platforms aiming to automate candidate research.
* Helps organizations build predictive hiring models and gain actionable talent intelligence.


## 2. What problem this workflow solves

Recruiters often face information overload when analyzing candidate resume manually reviewing experiences, skills, and cultural fit is slow and inconsistent.

Traditional scraping tools extract raw data but fail to produce actionable intelligence like career trajectory, skills alignment, and fit for a role.

This workflow solves that by:

* Automating candidate resume data extraction through Decodo
* Structuring it into JSON Resume Schema
* Running deep AI-driven analytics using OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
* Delivering comprehensive candidate intelligence ready for ATS/CRM integration or HR dashboards


## 3. What this workflow does

This n8n workflow combines Decodo’s web scraping with OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to produce advanced recruitment intelligence.

### Flow Breakdown:

1. **Manual Trigger** – Start the workflow manually or schedule it in n8n.
2. **Set Input Fields** – Define resume URL, location, and job description.
3. **Decodo Node** – Scrapes the candidate’s profile (experience, skills, education, achievements, etc.).
4. **Structured Data Extractor (GPT-4o-mini)** – Converts the scraped data into a structured JSON Resume Schema.
5. **Advanced Data Mining Engine (GPT-4o-mini)** 

– Performs:

   * **Skills Analysis** (strengths, gaps, transferable skills)
   * **Experience Intelligence** (career trajectory, leadership, project complexity)
   * **Cultural Fit Insights** (work style, communication style, agility indicators)
   * **Career Trajectory Forecasting** (promotion trends, growth velocity)
   * **Competitive Advantage Analysis** (market positioning, salary expectations)
6. **Summarizer Node** – Produces an abstractive and comprehensive AI summary of the candidate profile.
7. **Google Sheets Node** – Saves the structured insights automatically into your recruitment intelligence sheet.
8. **File Writer Node (Optional)** – Writes the JSON report locally for offline storage or integration.

The result is a data-enriched candidate intelligence report far beyond what traditional resume parsing provides.
