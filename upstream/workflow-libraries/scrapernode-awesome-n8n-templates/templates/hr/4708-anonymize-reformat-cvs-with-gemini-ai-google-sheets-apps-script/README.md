An advanced N8N workflow to anonymize and reformat resumes for internal or external distribution

### 🔍 Overview
This template **automates the anonymization, structuring, and reformatting of CVs/resumes** using a combination of AI, PDF parsing, and Google Apps Script.

Extracts Content from the PDF
2.Uses Gemini Flash 2.0 to intelligently structure the resume content
3. Stores the structured data in a Google Sheet
4. Generates a New CV from a customizable template via Google Apps Script
5. Anonymizes Names (e.g. “John Doe” → “J. D.”)
5. (Optional) Sends or downloads the final anonymized version

### 🛠️ Setup Requirements
To use this workflow, you’ll need to configure:

- Your input/output folders
Field mappings (e.g. what to extract)
- A Google Apps Script endpoint for PDF generation
