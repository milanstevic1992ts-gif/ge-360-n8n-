[ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) has maintained scrapers for [Indeed jobs](https://scrapernode.com/indeed/scrapers/jobs), [Glassdoor reviews](https://scrapernode.com/glassdoor/scrapers/reviews), and [Glassdoor jobs](https://scrapernode.com/glassdoor/scrapers/jobs) that handle all of that for you.
