Automatically extract, evaluate, and shortlist multiple resumes against a selected job description using GPT-4. This smart, scalable n8n workflow helps HR/TA teams streamline hiring decisions while keeping results structured, auditable, and easy to share.

## 👤 Who’s it for

This workflow is designed for:
- HR or Talent Acquisition (TA) teams handling **multiple candidates** per role
- Recruiters who want **AI-assisted resume screening** to save time and reduce bias
- Organizations that want to **automatically log evaluations** and keep stakeholders updated in real-time via Slack or Sheets

---

## ⚙️ How it works / What it does

1. HR/TA uploads multiple candidate resumes and selects a job role
2. Each resume is:
   - Uploaded to Google Drive
   - Parsed with GPT-4 to extract structured profile data
3. The job description for the selected role is:
   - Retrieved from Google Sheets
   - Downloaded from Drive and parsed
4. The profile + JD are sent to an AI agent to generate:
   - Fit score
   - Strengths & gaps
   - Final recommendation
5. Results are:
   - Appended to the evaluation tracking sheet
   - Optionally shared with the hiring team on Slack
   - Used to trigger emails to qualified or unqualified candidates
