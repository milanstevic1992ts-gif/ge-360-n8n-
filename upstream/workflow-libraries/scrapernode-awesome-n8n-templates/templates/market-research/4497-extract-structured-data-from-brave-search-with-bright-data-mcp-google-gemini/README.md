### Notice
Community nodes can only be installed on self-hosted instances of n8n.

### Who this is for
The Brave Search Structured Data Extractor workflow is designed for professionals and teams that need high-quality, structured insights from Brave search results in real time. Whether you're performing market research, tracking competitors, training AI models, or powering content engines, this workflow offers a robust and automated solution.

This workflow is tailored for:

**Market Researchers** - Who analyze trends across multimedia channels

**AI Developers** - Who require clean, structured datasets for model fine-tuning

**SEO & Content** - Analysts looking to monitor visibility across news, images, and videos

**Media Researchers** - Curating timely and relevant information across formats

**Automation Engineers** - Integrating search insights into downstream workflows

### What problem is this workflow solving?
Traditional web scraping and search result parsing is fragmented, inconsistent, and prone to errors, especially when dealing with multimedia (images, videos, news) data from search engines. This workflow provides:

- Centralized Brave search data extraction across all content types. Switches the search execution based upon the type of search that is being set. ex: news, images, videos, all

- Automated structured data transformation using Google Gemini

- Unified output persistence and notification across disk, webhook, and Google Sheets

### What this workflow does

**Input Configuration**

- Define your Brave search query

- Set the search type: videos, images, news, or all

- Configure your Bright Data MCP zone

**Bright Data MCP Search Execution**

- Initiates a Brave search via Bright Data MCP using the correct URL pattern for each search type

- Returns raw HTML of search results

**Google Gemini LLM** 

- Structured Data Extraction

- Transforms raw results into structured data (e.g., title, URL, source, snippet)

**Output Handling**

- Save to disk (e.g., JSON or CSV file)

- Send Webhook notification with structured data (e.g., Slack, internal dashboards)

- Store in Google Sheets for team-wide access or dashboarding
