## Description

## Analyze YouTube videos for virality with an AI-powered report

This workflow automates the discovery and analysis of potentially viral YouTube videos. It searches for recent, popular videos based on a keyword, calculates a unique **"Algorithmic Lift Score"** to measure virality, and uses an AI agent to generate an insightful summary report that is sent directly to your email.

## What it does

This workflow identifies videos that are outperforming their channel's baseline, a key indicator of viral potential. It operates in several stages:
1.  **Searches YouTube:** It finds recent, top-performing videos based on your specified keyword and timeframe.
2.  **Gathers Data:** For each video found, it fetches detailed statistics for both the video (views, likes, comments) and its channel (subscriber count, total views).
3.  **Calculates Virality Score:** It calculates an "Algorithmic Lift Score" for each video. This custom metric prioritizes videos that achieve high view counts and engagement relative to their channel's subscriber base.
4.  **Analyzes with AI:** The top 5 videos, sorted by their virality score, are sent to an AI agent (pre-configured for OpenAI). The AI generates a concise summary highlighting trends, top performers, and other noteworthy patterns.
5.  **Sends Email Report:** The final AI-generated analysis is converted to HTML and emailed to you, providing a ready-to-read report on what's trending in your niche.

## Who it's for

This workflow is perfect for:
*   **Content Creators** looking for trending topics and content ideas.
*   **Digital Marketers** conducting competitor analysis or market research.

## Requirements

*   An **OpenAI API Key** (or another compatible AI model credential).
*   A connected **Gmail account** in n8n to send the final report.
