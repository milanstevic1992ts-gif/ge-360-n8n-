## Description

This workflow automatically scrapes Amazon price-drop data via Decodo, extracts structured product details with OpenAI, generates summaries and sentiment insights for each item, and saves everything to Google Sheets — creating a fully automated price-intelligence pipeline.

## Disclaimer

Please note - This workflow is only available on n8n self-hosted as it’s making use of the community node for the Decodo Web Scraping

![Extract, Summarize, Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Price Drops via Decodo](fileId:3407)

## Who this is for

This workflow is designed for e-commerce analysts, product researchers, price-tracking teams, and affiliate marketers who want to:

- Monitor daily Amazon product price drops automatically.
- Extract key information such as product name, price, discount, and links.
- Generate AI-driven summaries and sentiment insights on the latest deals.
- Store all structured data directly in Google Sheets for trend analysis and reporting.

## What problem this workflow solves

This workflow solves the following:

- Eliminates the need for manual data scraping or tracking.
- Turns unstructured web data into structured datasets.
- Adds AI-generated summaries and sentiment analysis for smarter decision-making.
- Enables automated, daily price intelligence tracking across multiple product categories.


## What this workflow does

This automation combines Decodo’s web scraping, OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini, and Google Sheets to deliver an end-to-end price intelligence system.

**Trigger & Setup**  
   - Manually start the workflow.
   - Input your price-drop URL (default: [CamelCamelCamel Daily Drops](https://camelcamelcamel.com/top_drops?t=daily)).

**Web Scraping via Decodo**  
   - Decodo scrapes the Amazon price-drop listings and extracts product details (title, price, savings, product link).

**LLM-Powered Data Structuring**  
   - The extracted content is sent to OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini to format and clean the output into structured JSON fields.

**Loop & Deep Analysis**  
   - Each product URL is revisited by Decodo for content enrichment.
   - The AI performs two analyses per product:
     - **Summarization:** Generates a comprehensive summary of the product.
     - **Sentiment Analysis:** Detects tone (positive/neutral/negative), sentiment score, and key topics.

**Aggregation & Storage**  
   - All enriched results are merged and aggregated.
   - Structured data is automatically appended to a connected Google Sheet.

**End Result:**  

A ready-to-use dataset showing each price-dropped product, its summary, sentiment polarity, and key highlights updated in real time.
