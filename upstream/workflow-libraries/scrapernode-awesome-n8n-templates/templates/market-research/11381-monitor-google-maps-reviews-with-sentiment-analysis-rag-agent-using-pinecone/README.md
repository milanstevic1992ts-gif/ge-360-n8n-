If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

## Analyze and Sync Google Maps Reviews to Pinecone

&gt; **Note:** This template requires an Apify account, an OpenAI account, and a Pinecone database.

### Overview
This workflow automates your reputation management by scraping Google Maps reviews, analyzing their sentiment using AI, and storing them in a Vector Database (Pinecone). It also includes a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent that allows you to chat with your review data via Telegram to ask specific questions about customer feedback.

### How it works
* **Scrape:** At a scheduled time (or manually), the workflow triggers an Apify actor to scrape the latest reviews from a specific Google Maps URL.
* **Analyze:** It uses GPT-4o to analyze the sentiment of the reviews and generates a summary of complaints and praises.
* **Notify:** A Telegram message is sent with the sentiment score and a summary of the latest reviews.
* **Store:** The review data is embedded and upserted into a Pinecone Vector Store.
* **Chat (RAG):** You can send messages to a Telegram bot to query the database (e.g., "What are people saying about our coffee?"). The AI retrieves relevant reviews from Pinecone to answer your question.
* **Cleanup:** A weekly schedule cleans up the namespace to ensure data freshness (optional).

### How to set up
1. **Apify:** Create an account and subscribe to the *Google Maps Reviews Scraper* actor. Set up your Apify credentials in n8n.
