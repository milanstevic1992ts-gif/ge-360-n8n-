> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

## Description

# Automated TikTok Real Estate Research for Couples

This workflow automates the process of finding real estate (rental) videos on TikTok, filtering them for a specific target audience (couples in their 20s), generating an explanation of why they are recommended, and saving the results to Google Sheets and Slack.

## Who’s it for
*   **Real Estate Agents & Marketers:** To research trending rental properties and video styles popular on social media.
*   **Content Curators:** To automatically gather and summarize niche content from TikTok.
*   **House Hunters:** To automate the search for "rental" videos tailored to couples.

## How it works / What it does
1.  **Trigger:** The workflow starts manually (on click).
2.  **Scrape TikTok:** It connects to **Apify** to run a "TikTok Scraper". It searches for videos with the hashtag `賃貸` (Rental) and retrieves metadata.
3.  **Filter & Extract (AI Agent 1):** An AI Agent (using **OpenRouter**) analyzes the retrieved video data to select properties suitable for "couples in their 20s" and outputs the video URL.
4.  **Generate Insights (AI Agent 2):** A second AI Agent reviews the URL/content and generates a specific reason why this property is recommended for the target audience, formatting the output with the URL and explanation.
5.  **Save to Database:** The final text (URL + Reason) is appended to a **Google Sheet**.
6.  **Notify Team:** The same recommendation text is sent to a specific **Slack** channel to alert the user.

## Requirements
*   **n8n:** Version 1.0 or later.
*   **Apify Account:** You need an API token and access to the `clockworks/tiktok-scraper` actor.
*   **OpenRouter Account:** An API Key to use Large Language Models (LLMs) for the AI Agents.
*   **Google Cloud Platform:** A project with the Google Sheets API enabled and OAuth credentials.
*   **Slack Workspace:** Permission to add apps/bots to a channel.

## How to set up
1.  **Import the Workflow:** Copy the JSON code and paste it into your n8n editor.
2.  **Configure Credentials:**
    *   **Apify:** Create a new credential in n8n using your Apify API Token.
    *   **OpenRouter:** Create a new credential using your OpenRouter API Key.
    *   **Google Sheets:** Connect your Google account via OAuth2.
    *   **Slack:** Connect your Slack account via OAuth2.
3.  **Configure Nodes:**
    *   **Google Sheets Node:** Select your specific Spreadsheet and Sheet from the dropdown lists (replace the placeholders `YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID` etc. if they don't update automatically).
    *   **Slack Node:** Select the Channel where you want to receive notifications (replace `YOUR_CHANNEL_ID`).
4.  **Test:** Click "Execute Workflow" to run a test.

## How to customize the workflow
*   **Change the Search Topic:** Open the **Apify** node and change the `hashtags` value in the "Custom Body" JSON (e.g., change `"賃貸"` to `"DIY"` or `"Travel"`).
*   **Adjust the Persona:** Open the **AI Agent** nodes and modify the `text` prompt. You can change the target audience from "20s couples" to "students" or "families."
*   **Increase Volume:** In the **Apify** node, increase the `resultsPerPage` or `maxProfilesPerQuery` to process more videos at once (note: this will consume more API credits).
*   **Change Output Format:** Modify the **Google Sheets** node to map specific fields (like Video Title, Author, Likes) into separate columns instead of just one raw output string.
