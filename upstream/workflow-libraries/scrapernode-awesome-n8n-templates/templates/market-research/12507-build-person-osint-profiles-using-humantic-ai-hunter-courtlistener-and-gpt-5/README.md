> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

## Who is this for

This workflow is designed for sales professionals, recruiters, and researchers who need to:
- Build comprehensive profiles of individuals from public sources
- Understand communication and personality styles before outreach
- Find verified contact information
- Research legal and public record history for individuals

It's ideal for animal advocacy campaigns targeting corporate decision-makers, researchers profiling legislators on animal welfare issues, and activists preparing for meetings with executives at companies being asked to adopt animal welfare policies.

## What it does

This multi-source OSINT agent creates comprehensive individual profiles:
1. **Personality analysis**: Uses Humantic AI to analyze LinkedIn profiles for communication preferences, personality traits, and engagement recommendations
2. **Contact discovery**: Uses Hunter.io to find and verify professional email addresses
3. **Legal research**: Searches CourtListener for any court cases involving the individual
4. **Legislation involvement**: Checks LegiScan for any legislative activity or testimony
5. **Document search**: Searches DocumentCloud for government documents mentioning the person
6. **Web research**: Uses Serper to find news articles, publications, and public appearances
7. **Synthesis**: Combines all findings into an actionable intelligence report

The workflow waits for Humantic AI profile generation (45 seconds) before retrieving the complete personality analysis.

## How to set up

1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance
2. Configure the required API credentials:
   - **Humantic AI API** for personality analysis
   - **Hunter API** for email finding
   - **CourtListener API** for court case searches
   - **LegiScan API** for legislation searches
   - **Serper API** for web searches
   - **Jina AI API** for content extraction
   - **OpenRouter API** for AI synthesis
3. Test with a public figure to verify all integrations
4. Activate the workflow

### Example usage
