## 🛠 How to Customize
* **Add More Data Points:** Modify the JavaScript code in the "Extract Competitor Data from HTML" node to parse and extract additional information from the HTML.
* **Custom Filtering:** Implement logic to exclude specific domains, filter results by title length, or other criteria.
* **Expand Geographic Coverage:** Add more 2-letter ISO country codes to the Bright Data SERP API call to broaden your competitive analysis.
* **Batch Processing:** Adjust the settings in the "Process Keywords in Batches" node to optimize for your Bright Data plan and desired execution speed.
* **Rate Limiting:** Modify the "Wait" node (default: 30 seconds) to increase or decrease the delay between requests based on API limits or performance needs.

## 📊 Use Cases & Examples
* **SEO Competitive Analysis:** Identify top-ranking competitors for your target keywords and analyze their strategies.

## 📈 Performance & Limits
* **Single Keyword:** 30–60 seconds per keyword.
* **Batch of 10 Keywords:** Typically takes 5–10 minutes.
* **Large Lists (50+ Keywords):** Expect execution times of 30–60 minutes or more, depending on batching and rate limits.
* **Success Rate:** Generally 95%+ for data extraction.
* **Data Accuracy:** Typically 98%+ for extracted fields.
* **API Calls:** 1 Bright Data SERP API call per keyword, plus multiple Google Sheets writes per execution.
* **Rate Limit:** A 30-second delay between requests is recommended to prevent exceeding API limits.

---

## 🧰 Troubleshooting
* **Bright Data API error:** Double-check your API token, ensure you have sufficient credits, and confirm SERP API access is enabled on your Bright Data account.
* **No keywords found:** Verify the Google Sheet ID and ensure the column headers in your "Keywords" sheet precisely match the specifications (e.g., "Keyword", "Country").
* **Google Sheets permission denied:** Re-authenticate your Google Sheets credentials within n8n and check that the correct sharing settings are applied to your sheets.
* **No results extracted:** Review the JavaScript parsing logic in the "Extract Competitor Data from HTML" node. Also, verify the validity of your keywords and target countries.
* **Loop not processing all:** Check the batch settings in the "Process Keywords in Batches" node and ensure all connections within the loop are correctly configured.
