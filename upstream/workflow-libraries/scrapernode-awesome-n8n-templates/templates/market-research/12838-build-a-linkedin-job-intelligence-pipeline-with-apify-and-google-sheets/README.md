> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## LinkedIn Job Intelligence Automation (n8n + Apify)

This workflow creates a **fully automated LinkedIn job intelligence system** that continuously scrapes job postings, enriches them with time-based insights, removes duplicates, and stores them in a structured Google Sheet for analysis, outreach, or decision-making.

Built for founders, recruiters, sales teams, and consultants who want **real-time hiring signals** instead of static lead databases, this workflow turns job postings into **actionable business intelligence**.
