## Description

## Competitor Price Monitoring with AI-Powered Alerts

### What this workflow does

This workflow automatically monitors competitor product prices on a scheduled basis, detects meaningful price changes, and delivers actionable alerts enriched with AI-powered competitive analysis.

It compares current and historical price datasets, identifies increases, decreases, new products, and removals, and uses AI to assess market impact and recommend strategic actions. Alerts are intelligently routed to Slack or Email based on urgency, while all results are logged for auditing and trend analysis.

This template is ideal for pricing teams, product managers, and competitive intelligence workflows that require timely, data-driven insights without manual monitoring.

### How it works

1. **Scheduled execution**
   - Runs on a configurable cron schedule (default: every 6 hours).
   - Initializes a monitoring session with timestamps and tracking IDs.

2. **Price data collection**
   - Fetches current competitor pricing via HTTP APIs.
   - Retrieves previous price snapshots from Google Sheets.

3. **Data normalization & comparison**
   - Normalizes current and historical data into a unified schema.
   - Uses the **Compare Datasets** node to detect:
     - New products
     - Removed products
     - Price increases or decreases
     - Unchanged prices

4. **Change evaluation**
   - Calculates percentage price changes.
   - Classifies severity:
     - **Urgent**: ≥ 10% change
     - **Routine**: 5–10% change
     - **No alert**: &lt; 5% or unchanged

5. **AI-powered analysis**
   - An AI agent evaluates competitive impact.
   - Generates concise recommendations (match, hold, differentiate).
   - Justifies urgency based on market implications.

6. **Smart alert routing**
   - Urgent changes are sent to Slack.
   - Routine updates are sent via Email.
   - All alerts and runs are logged in Google Sheets.

7. **Historical storage**
   - Updates price history for future comparisons.
   - Maintains a complete monitoring audit trail.

---

### Customization ideas

- Add additional alert channels (Microsoft Teams, Discord, Webhooks).
- Extend AI analysis with competitor positioning or elasticity insights.
- Monitor multiple regions or currencies.
- Add dashboards using BI tools connected to Google Sheets.
- Trigger downstream pricing or promotion workflows automatically.
