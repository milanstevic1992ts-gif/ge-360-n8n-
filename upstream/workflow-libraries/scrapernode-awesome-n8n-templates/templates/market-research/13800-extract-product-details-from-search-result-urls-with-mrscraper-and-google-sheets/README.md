> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

## Description

This n8n template automates the extraction of structured product data from search results pages — using a pre-built list of search/listing URLs stored in Google Sheets as the starting point. Instead of crawling a domain from scratch, this workflow picks up exactly where your research left off: you bring the URLs, it brings the data.

Perfect for price monitoring, product research, competitor analysis, or building any kind of structured product database from e-commerce or directory sites.

## How It Works

* **Phase 1 – Load Search Page URLs:** The workflow reads your pre-prepared list of search or listing page URLs directly from a Google Sheets tab. This gives you full control over which pages get scraped without any crawling step.
* **Phase 2 – Scrape Listing Pages:** Each URL is looped through the Listing Agent, which navigates the search results page and extracts all individual product/detail page URLs. Duplicates are automatically removed.
* **Phase 3 – Scrape Detail Pages:** Every detail URL is then processed by the General Agent, which extracts structured fields such as title, price, description, attributes, and more. Nested JSON is automatically flattened into clean, spreadsheet-ready rows.
* **Phase 4 – Export & Notify:** All scraped records are appended or upserted into a Google Sheets output tab. A Gmail notification is sent on completion with a run summary.

## How to Set Up

1. **Create 2 scrapers in your MrScraper account:**
   * Listing Agent Scraper (for extracting detail URLs from search/listing pages)
   * General Agent Scraper (for extracting structured data from each detail page)
   * Copy the `scraperId` for each — you'll need these in n8n.

2. **Enable AI Scraper API access** in your MrScraper account settings.

3. **Prepare your Google Sheet with search URLs:**
   * Create a sheet with a column containing the listing/search page URLs you want to scrape
   * This is your input — add as many URLs as needed

4. **Add your credentials in n8n:**
   * MrScraper API token
   * Google Sheets OAuth2 (for both input and output sheets)
   * Gmail OAuth2

5. **Configure the "Get List Search Page" node:**
   * Connect to the spreadsheet and sheet tab containing your input URLs

6. **Configure the Listing Agent node:**
   * Enter your Listing `scraperId`
   * Adjust `maxPages` based on how many result pages to scrape per URL

7. **Configure the General Agent node:**
   * Enter your General `scraperId`

8. **Configure the output Google Sheets node:**
   * Enter your output spreadsheet and sheet tab URL
   * Set a unique match key (recommended: `url`) for upsert to avoid duplicates on re-runs

9. **Configure Gmail:**
   * Set recipient email, subject line, and message body for your run notification

## Requirements

* **MrScraper** account with API access enabled
* **Google Sheets** (OAuth2 connected) — one sheet for input URLs, one for output data
* **Gmail** (OAuth2 connected)

## Good to Know

* Unlike a full crawl workflow, this template is **input-driven** — you control exactly which pages are scraped by managing your Google Sheets input list.
* You can run this on a schedule and simply add new URLs to the input sheet whenever you want fresh data scraped.
* The `Flatten Object` node handles deeply nested JSON automatically, so most sites won't require any manual field mapping.
* Use upsert mode with a unique key in the output sheet to safely re-run the workflow without creating duplicate rows.

---

## Customising This Workflow

* **Scheduled monitoring:** Replace the manual trigger with a Schedule Trigger and keep your input sheet updated to run automated price or availability checks.
* **Multi-category tracking:** Organise your input sheet by category or source site and add a Filter node to process specific subsets on each run.
* **Add data enrichment:** Insert an AI node after Phase 3 to summarise descriptions, classify products, or translate content before saving to Sheets.
* **Slack or webhook alerts:** Swap the Gmail node for a Slack or webhook notification if you prefer real-time alerts in a different channel.
