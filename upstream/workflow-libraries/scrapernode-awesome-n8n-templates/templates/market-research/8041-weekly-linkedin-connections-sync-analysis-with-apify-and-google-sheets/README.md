# 📊 Weekly LinkedIn connections sync & analysis with Apify and Google Sheets

> ⚡ **141 views** · 📊 [Market Research & Insights](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

# 💼 Auto-Sync LinkedIn Connections to Google Sheets (Apify + n8n)

This workflow automatically **scrapes your LinkedIn connections using Apify**, processes the data, and logs it into a structured **Google Sheet** every week. It also generates a summary of top companies, locations, and industries across your network.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Weekly Sync (Sunday 2 AM)**  
   - A **Cron node** triggers the workflow weekly (default: Sunday at 2 AM).  
   - Frequency can be adjusted.  

2. **Start LinkedIn Scrape**  
   - Calls the **Apify LinkedIn Scraper Actor** with your credentials.  
   - Initiates a scraping run for all your LinkedIn connections.  

3. **Extract Run ID & Wait**  
   - Extracts the scrape run ID from Apify’s response.  
   - Waits 30 seconds before checking status (retries every 60s until completed).  

4. **Check Scrape Status**  
   - Confirms if the scrape has finished successfully.  
   - If not completed, waits and retries until done.  

5. **Get Scraped Data**  
   - Fetches scraped connection data from the Apify dataset.  
   - Includes fields like name, title, company, location, industry, mutual connections, and profile URL.  

6. **Process Connections Data**  
   - A **Code node** cleans and normalizes the scraped data.  
   - Removes incomplete profiles, trims whitespace, merges duplicate fields.  

7. **Save to Google Sheets**  
   - Clears existing data and appends the latest connections to your Google Sheet.  
   - Headers include:  
     ```
     Name | Title | Company | Location | Profile URL 
     Connection Date | Industry | Mutual Connections
     ```  

8. **Generate Sync Summary**  
   - Analyzes all saved connections.  
   - Produces quick stats:  
     - Total connections synced  
     - Top 5 companies  
     - Top 5 locations  
     - Industry breakdown
