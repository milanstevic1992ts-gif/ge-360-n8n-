If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

# Track brand visibility on Perplexity and ChatGPT with BrowserAct & OpenRouter

## Introduction

This workflow acts as a "Generative Engine Optimization" (GEO) tracker. It automatically monitors how your brand is being recommended on AI-powered search engines by simulating real user queries on Perplexity and ChatGPT, analyzing the responses for visibility and sentiment, and reporting the findings to Slack.

## Target Audience

Brand managers, SEO specialists, and marketing teams who need to monitor their "share of voice" in AI search results.

## How it works

1. **Scheduling:** A **Weekly Trigger** initiates the workflow to ensure regular monitoring of your brand's presence.
2. **Context Setup:** A **Set** node defines the target `Brand` name and a brief `Description` of the value proposition.
3. **Query Generation:** An **AI Agent** (using OpenRouter/GPT-4o) reads the brand details and generates two distinct search queries:
* **Research Query:** Targeted at Perplexity (e.g., "Top rated tools for X in 2025").
* **Conversational Query:** Targeted at ChatGPT (e.g., "I need advice on X, what do you recommend?").


4. **Parallel Execution:** The workflow splits into two parallel paths to maximize efficiency.
5. **Data Extraction:** Two separate **BrowserAct** nodes execute the generated queries on **Perplexity** and **ChatGPT** respectively.  They scrape the full text of the AI's response.
6. **Synchronization:** A **Merge** node waits for both scraping tasks to complete before proceeding.
7. **Analysis:** A second **AI Agent** acts as a "GEO Analyst." It compares the scraped answers against your Brand Name to determine if the brand was "Visible" (recommended), "Invisible" (ignored), or "Hallucinated." It also grades the sentiment.
8. **Reporting:** A **Slack** node posts a formatted report detailing the visibility status on both platforms.

## How to set up

1. **Configure Credentials:** Connect your **BrowserAct**, **OpenRouter**, and **Slack** accounts in n8n.
2. **Prepare BrowserAct:** Ensure the **AI Search Visibility Tracker (Perplexity & ChatGPT)** template is saved in your BrowserAct account.
3. **Define Brand:** Open the **Add Brand & Description** node. Update the `Brand` field with your company name and the `Description` field with your core offering.
4. **Select Slack Channel:** Open the **Send team update** node and select the channel where reports should be posted.

## Requirements

* **BrowserAct Account:** Required for scraping the AI platforms. Template: **AI Search Visibility Tracker (Perplexity & ChatGPT)**.
* **OpenRouter Account:** Required for generating queries and analyzing the sentiment of the results.
* **Slack Account:** Required for receiving the final visibility report.

## How to customize the workflow

1. **Add More Engines:** Clone the BrowserAct node to add checks for **Google Gemini** or **Claude**, then connect them to the Merge node.
2. **Track Competitors:** Modify the **Add Brand & Description** node to input a competitor's name instead of your own to see how AI recommends them.
3. **Store History:** Add a **Google Sheets** node before the Slack step to log the "Sentiment Score" and "Visibility Status" over time for trend analysis.
