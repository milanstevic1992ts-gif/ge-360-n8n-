> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

This n8n workflow demonstrates a simple multi-agent setup to perform the task of competitor research. It showcases how using the HTTP request tool could reduce the number of nodes needed to achieve a workflow like this.

## How it works
* For this template, a source company is defined by the user which is sent to Exa.ai to find competitors.
* Each competitor is then funnelled through 3 AI agents that will go out onto the internet and retrieve specific datapoints about the competitor; company overview, product offering and customer reviews.
* Once the agents are finished, the results are compiled into a report which is then inserted in a notion database.

Check out an example output here: https://jimleuk.notion.site/2d1c3c726e8e42f3aecec6338fd24333?v=de020fa196f34cdeb676daaeae44e110&pvs=4

## Requirements

* An OpenAI account for the LLM.
* Exa.ai account for access to their AI search engine.
* SerpAPI account for Google search.
* Firecrawl.dev account for webscraping.
* Notion.com account for database to save final reports.

## Customising the workflow

Add additional agents to gather more datapoints such as SEO keywords and metrics.

Not using notion? Feel free to swap this out for your own database.
