> 💡 **Pro Tip** — YouTube's API quotas can be a bottleneck when you're pulling data at scale. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/youtube) is a community node with dedicated scrapers for [channels](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/channels), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/videos), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/comments) — no quota limits, just structured data.

## Description

🧠 How it works
This workflow lets users generate structured summaries from YouTube videos directly inside Slack using n8n, AssemblyAI, and OpenAI.

When a user submits a YouTube link via a Slack slash command, the workflow extracts the video ID and validates the video duration. Videos longer than the supported limit are stopped early with a clear message sent back to Slack.

For valid videos, the workflow downloads the video audio as an MP3 file and sends it to AssemblyAI for transcription. Once the transcription is complete, the transcript is passed to an AI model to generate a structured summary.

The final result includes a concise TL;DR, key takeaways, and notable quotes, which are formatted and posted back to Slack asynchronously using the original response URL.
