## Description

## 📘 Description
This workflow performs automated market demand research for a defined niche on a scheduled basis and converts raw public discussions into actionable business insights. It continuously scans search engines and social platforms to identify real customer pain points, unmet needs, buying or switching intent, and dissatisfaction with existing tools or solutions.
An AI market research agent analyzes public conversations to filter out noise and extract only high-signal demand indicators. These insights are then transformed into two outputs: a concise Notion-ready research summary for internal knowledge tracking and a professional, customer-ready email that communicates key findings in clear, business-friendly language. Built-in validation and error handling ensure reliability and traceability.
This workflow replaces repetitive manual market research with a consistent, insight-driven intelligence pipeline that supports founders, marketers, and growth teams.
