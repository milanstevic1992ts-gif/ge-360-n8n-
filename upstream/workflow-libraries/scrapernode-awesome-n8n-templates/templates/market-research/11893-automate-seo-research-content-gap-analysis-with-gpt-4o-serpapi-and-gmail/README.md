## Description

📘 Description
This workflow automates keyword-level SEO research and content opportunity discovery using live Google SERP data and AI-driven analysis. It takes a single keyword request, pulls real-time search results for the India market, converts raw SERP data into a structured SEO dataset, analyzes search intent and competition, identifies content gaps and high-impact opportunities, and delivers client-ready insights via email while logging results for tracking and audits.

Instead of manual keyword research, competitive scanning, and reporting, the system derives actionable SEO strategy directly from live search behavior. Outputs are structured for UI consumption, professional email delivery, and historical storage in Google Sheets. Any workflow failure triggers an automated Slack alert with diagnostic details.

This workflow replaces manual SEO research, gap analysis, reporting, and documentation with a repeatable, automated SEO intelligence pipeline.
