> ⚡ **290 views** · 📊 [Market Research & Insights](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

## What it does

The workflow takes a **keyword**, searches TikTok for matching creator profiles, retrieves their latest videos, extracts viewer comments, and uses **GPT-4** to identify the most frequently asked questions. These questions can be used to inspire new content, shape engagement strategies, or create FAQ-style videos that directly address what your audience is curious about.

Here’s what happens step by step:  
1. Accepts a keyword from a form trigger  
2. Uses **Dumpling AI** to search TikTok for relevant profiles  
3. Fetches the most recent videos from each profile  
4. Extracts and cleans comments using a Python script  
5. Sends cleaned comments to **GPT-4** to find recurring audience questions  
6. Saves the top questions and video links into a Data Table for easy review
