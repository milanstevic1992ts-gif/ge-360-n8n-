> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

## 📄 What this workflow does

This workflow helps you analyze Google reviews of any business to generate powerful marketing insights. By simply submitting a business name and its Google Place ID, it fetches the top 30 reviews and uses GPT-4 (via LangChain Agent) to extract valuable customer insights such as marketing angles, customer motivations, product pain points, and voice of customer (VOC) quotes. The output is stored automatically in a connected Google Sheet.
