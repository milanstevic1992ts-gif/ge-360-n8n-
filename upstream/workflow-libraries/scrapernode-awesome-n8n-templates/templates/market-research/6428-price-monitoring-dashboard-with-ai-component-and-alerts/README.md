# Competitor Price Monitoring Dashboard with AI and Real-time Alerts

## 🎯 Target Audience
- E-commerce managers and pricing analysts
- Retail business owners monitoring competitor pricing
- Marketing teams tracking market positioning
- Product managers analyzing competitive landscape
- Data analysts conducting pricing intelligence
- Business strategists making pricing decisions

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Manual competitor price monitoring is inefficient and often leads to missed opportunities or delayed responses to market changes. This template solves the challenge of automatically tracking competitor prices, detecting significant changes, and providing actionable insights for strategic pricing decisions.

## 🔧 How it Works

This workflow automatically monitors competitor product prices using AI-powered web scraping, analyzes price trends, and sends real-time alerts when significant changes are detected.

### Key Components

1. **Scheduled Trigger** - Runs the workflow at specified intervals to maintain up-to-date price data
2. **AI-Powered Scraping** - Uses ScrapeGraphAI to intelligently extract pricing information from competitor websites
3. **Price Analysis Engine** - Processes historical data to detect trends and anomalies
4. **Alert System** - Sends notifications via Slack and email when price changes exceed thresholds
5. **Dashboard Integration** - Stores all data in Google Sheets for comprehensive analysis and reporting

## 📊 Google Sheets Column Specifications

The template creates the following columns in your Google Sheets:

| Column | Data Type | Description | Example |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **timestamp** | DateTime | When the price was recorded | "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z" |
| **competitor_name** | String | Name of the competitor | "Amazon" |
| **product_name** | String | Product name and model | "iPhone 15 Pro 128GB" |
| **current_price** | Number | Current price in USD | 999.00 |
| **previous_price** | Number | Previous recorded price | 1099.00 |
| **price_change** | Number | Absolute price difference | -100.00 |
| **price_change_percent** | Number | Percentage change | -9.09 |
| **product_url** | URL | Direct link to product page | "https://amazon.com/iphone15" |
| **alert_triggered** | Boolean | Whether alert was sent | true |
| **trend_direction** | String | Price trend analysis | "Decreasing" |
