## Description

# Skool Community Scraper Using Olostep API  

This n8n template automates scraping content from **Skool communities** using the Olostep API.  
It collects structured data from Skool pages and stores it in a clean format, making it easy to analyze communities, extract insights, or build datasets for research and outreach.

## Who’s it for  
- Community builders researching Skool groups  
- Marketers analyzing competitor or niche communities  
- SaaS founders validating ideas through community data  
- Automation builders collecting structured social data  
- Anyone who wants Skool data without manual scraping  

## How it works / What it does  
1. **Trigger**  
   - The workflow starts with a manual trigger or form input containing a Skool URL or query.

2. **Skool Page Scraping**  
   - The workflow uses the Olostep API to scrape Skool community pages.  
   - Extracts structured data using LLM-based parsing.

3. **Data Extraction**  
   - Depending on configuration, the workflow can extract:  
     - Community name  
     - Post titles and content  
     - Author names  
     - Engagement metrics (likes, comments)  
     - URLs to posts or discussions  

4. **Parse & Normalize**  
   - The raw response is cleaned and split into individual items.  
   - Ensures consistent fields across all scraped entries.

5. **Deduplication**  
   - Duplicate posts or entries are automatically removed.

6. **Data Storage**  
   - The final structured data is stored in a table (Google Sheets or n8n Data Table).  
   - Ready for filtering, exporting, or further automation.

This workflow allows you to turn Skool communities into structured datasets without browser automation or manual copy/paste.

## How to set up  
1. Import the template into your n8n workspace.  
2. Add your **Olostep API key**.  
3. Define the Skool page or community URL you want to scrape.  
4. Connect your storage destination (Google Sheets or Data Table).  
5. Run the workflow and collect structured Skool data automatically.

## Requirements  
- n8n account (cloud or self-hosted)  
- Olostep API key  
- Google Sheets account or n8n Data Table  

## How to customize the workflow  
- Change extraction schema to capture more fields (timestamps, tags, replies).  
- Add pagination to scrape older posts.  
- Store data in Airtable, Notion, or a database.  
- Trigger scraping on a schedule instead of manually.  
- Combine with AI agents to summarize or analyze community discussions.
