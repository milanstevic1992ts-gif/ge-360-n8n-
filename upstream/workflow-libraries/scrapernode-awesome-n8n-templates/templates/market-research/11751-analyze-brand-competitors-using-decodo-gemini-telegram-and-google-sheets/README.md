## Who’s it for
This workflow is built for content researchers, SEO teams, marketers, educators, and analysts who want to discover and analyze Brand competitor content at scale.

It’s especially useful if you need structured insights from pages based on a search query, without manually opening or reviewing each result.


## How it works / What it does
This workflow turns a simple keyword into structured, actionable insights.

It starts when a user submits a query through a form. Decodo is used as the core technology to perform a Google search and return relevant organic results.

Decodo retrieves the page content, which is cleaned and converted into plain text. An AI agent powered by Gemini analyzes the content to generate clear key points and key takeaways.

The extracted insights, along with the source title and link, are saved to Google Sheets for easy review and analysis. A short summary is also sent to Telegram, making it easy to monitor results in real time.

## How to set up
1. Add your Decodo API credentials.
2. Connect your Google Gemini API credentials.
3. Connect Google Sheets OAuth.
4. Update the target Google Sheet and worksheet.
5. Submit a keyword to start the analysis.
