## Description

### Who this is for?
Indeed Data Scraper & Summarization with Airtable, Bright Data and Google Gemini is an automated workflow that extracts company profile information from Indeed using Bright Data Web Unlocker, transforms the data using Google Gemini's LLM, and forward the transformed response with the summary to a specified webhook for downstream use.
