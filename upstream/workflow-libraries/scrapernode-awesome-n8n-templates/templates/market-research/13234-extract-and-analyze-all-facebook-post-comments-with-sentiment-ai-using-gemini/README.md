### Key Advantages

#### ✅ 1. Full Automation

Eliminates manual work by automatically collecting and analyzing Facebook comments end-to-end.

#### ✅ 2. AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis

Uses Google Gemini to accurately classify user sentiment, enabling deeper insights into audience perception and engagement.

#### ✅  3. Structured Data Storage

Saves results directly into Google Sheets, making the data easy to analyze, share, and visualize with dashboards or reports.

#### ✅ 4. Duplicate-Safe Updates

The “append or update” logic ensures comments are not duplicated and can be refreshed if sentiment analysis changes.

#### ✅ 5. Scalable and Robust

Pagination handling, batch processing, and wait nodes allow the workflow to scale to large volumes of comments without hitting API limits.

#### ✅ 6. Modular Architecture

The use of sub-workflows makes the solution reusable and easy to integrate into larger automation pipelines (e.g. monitoring multiple posts or pages).

#### ✅ 7. Flexible Triggering

Can be run manually for testing or automatically as part of a broader workflow ecosystem.

### How it works

This workflow automates the process of fetching Facebook post comments, performing sentiment analysis on each comment, and storing the results in a Google Sheet. It operates in two modes:

1. **Manual execution mode**:
   - Starts with a Manual Trigger, where the user enters a Facebook Post ID.
   - The workflow fetches the post details, then retrieves all comments (including pagination).
   - It calls a separate "Facebook" workflow (via the `Call 'Facebook'` node) to process each comment batch through sentiment analysis and save results to Google Sheets.

2. **Triggered execution mode**:
   - Activated via the "When Executed by Another Workflow" trigger, receiving comment data directly.
   - It splits and batches the incoming comments, processes each through the sentiment analysis model (Google Gemini), and appends/updates records in Google Sheets.

### Set up steps

1. **Configure Facebook Graph API credentials**:
   - Add your Facebook Graph API credentials to both "Get Fb Post" and "Get Fb comments" nodes.

2. **Set up Google Gemini API credentials**:
   - Configure the "Google Gemini Chat Model" node with valid Google PaLM/Gemini API credentials.

3. **Prepare Google Sheet**:
   - Ensure the Google Sheet exists and is accessible via the Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials.
   - The sheet should have (or will automatically create) columns: `POST ID`, `COMMENT ID`, `COMMENT`, `SENTIMENT`.

4. **Configure the sub-workflow call**:
   - Ensure the "Call 'Facebook'" node points to a valid, existing workflow that can process comment data.

5. **Optional: Adjust batch and wait settings**:
   - Modify the "Loop Over Items" node if different batch sizes are needed.
   - Adjust the "Wait" node delay if required to avoid rate limits.

6. **Activate the workflow**:
   - Toggle the workflow to active if scheduled or webhook execution is desired.
   - Test using the Manual Trigger with a sample Facebook Post ID.
