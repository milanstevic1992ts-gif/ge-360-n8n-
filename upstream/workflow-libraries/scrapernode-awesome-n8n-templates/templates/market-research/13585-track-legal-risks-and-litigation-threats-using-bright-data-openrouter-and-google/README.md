If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

## Description
This workflow automatically monitors companies across courts, regulators, and jurisdictions to detect legal risk signals early. It helps legal, compliance, and risk teams stay ahead of litigation threats without manually scanning dozens of public sources.

## Overview
This workflow scrapes court records, regulatory filings, and legal news using Bright Data, then uses AI to classify, score, and cluster legal events by jurisdiction and topic. It filters noise, identifies high-risk cases, and generates executive-ready intelligence — including High-Risk Escalation Alerts and Litigation Monitoring Briefs — logged directly into Google Sheets dashboards.

## Tools Used
n8n: The automation platform that orchestrates the workflow.
Bright Data: For scraping court records, regulatory sources, and legal news without getting blocked.
OpenRouter: For AI-powered legal case classification, risk scoring, and report generation.
Google Sheets: For logging alerts, monitoring summaries, and error tracking.

## How to Install
Import the Workflow: Download the .json file and import it into your n8n instance.
Configure Bright Data: Add your Bright Data API credentials to the Bright Data node.
Configure OpenRouter: Add your OpenRouter API key for AI classification and report generation.
Set Up Google Sheets: Create a spreadsheet following the "Google Sheets Setup" sticky note inside the workflow, then connect each Google Sheets node to your document.
Customize: Edit the configuration node to set your target companies, jurisdictions, courts, and regulators.

## Use Cases
Corporate Legal Teams: Get early warnings on litigation involving your company or partners.
M&A Due Diligence: Screen acquisition targets for hidden legal exposure before closing deals.
Compliance Officers: Monitor regulatory actions across multiple jurisdictions in one place.
Risk Analysts: Track litigation density patterns and jurisdiction concentration risks.
