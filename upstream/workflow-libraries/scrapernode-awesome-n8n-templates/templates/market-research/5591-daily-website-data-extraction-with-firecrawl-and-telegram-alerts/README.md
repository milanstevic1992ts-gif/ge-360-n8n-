> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

🔥 Automated Daily Firecrawl Scraper with Telegram Alerts
Get structured insights scraped daily from the web using Firecrawl’s AI extraction engine — then send them directly to your Telegram chat.

🧰 What this workflow does:
This workflow automatically scrapes specific structured data from any webpage every day at a scheduled time using the Firecrawl API, checks if results are returned, and then sends the formatted results to Telegram.
