## Description

# Send Weekly GitHub Digest with Releases, Commits, and Trending Repos                                    
                                                       
  
Stay on top of the GitHub ecosystem with a single automated weekly email covering it all.  
                                                       
## How it works    

1. A schedule trigger fires every Monday at 9am and reads your config variables. Feel free to modify schedule.

2. Three branches run in parallel:
- Releases: fetches the latest release from each watched repo via the GitHub API
- Commits: fetches recent commits or public events for each tracked repo or username
- Trending: scrapes github.com/trending for that day's actual trending repositories

3. All three branches merge into a single Code node that builds one HTML email with three labeled sections.

4. If any content was found, the email is sent via Gmail. Otherwise the workflow exits silently.

## Setup steps

1. Connect your Gmail account.
2. Open Set Variables and configure:
- recipient_email — where to send the digest
- release_repos — list of repos to watch for releases (e.g. n8n-io/n8n)
- tracked_entities — GitHub usernames or owner/repo paths to track commits- days_back — lookback window in days (default: 7)
3. Activate.
