> ⚡ **6,942 views** · 📊 [Market Research & Insights](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

## Description

## Who's it for
Social media managers, content creators, brand managers, and marketing teams who need to track keyword performance and trending content across TikTok, Instagram, and Reddit for competitive analysis and content inspiration.
## What it does
This workflow automatically monitors trending content across three major social media platforms using specified keywords. It scrapes posts from TikTok, Instagram, and Reddit, calculates engagement scores using platform-specific metrics, ranks content by performance, and generates a comprehensive HTML email report with the top-performing posts across all platforms.
## How it works
The workflow follows a sequential multi-platform scraping process:

Reddit Scraping: Searches for keyword-based posts and comments with engagement metrics
Instagram Monitoring: Analyzes hashtag-based content with likes and comments data
TikTok Analysis: Tracks hashtag performance including views, likes, shares, and comments
Score Calculation: Applies platform-specific scoring algorithms based on engagement metrics
Unified Ranking: Combines and ranks all content across platforms by engagement score
Report Generation: Creates a detailed HTML email report with top performers and analytics

## Requirements

Apify account with API access
Gmail account for report delivery
Platform-specific scrapers: Reddit Scraper Lite, Instagram Scraper, TikTok Scraper

Result limits: maxItems: 50, maxPostCount: 25

Instagram configuration:

Hashtag URLs: Update directUrls with target hashtags

### Step 3: Set up email reporting

Customize email subject and styling as needed

### Step 4: Adjust scoring algorithms
Current scoring formulas:

Reddit: (upvotes × 1) + (comments × 2)
Instagram: (likes × 1) + (comments × 2)
TikTok: (likes × 1) + (comments × 2) + (shares × 3) + (views ÷ 1000)

Modify the code nodes to adjust scoring based on your priorities.

### Level classification
Content automatically categorized into performance tiers:

High: Score ≥ 10,000 (viral or highly engaging content)
Medium: Score ≥ 1,000 (good engagement, worth monitoring)
