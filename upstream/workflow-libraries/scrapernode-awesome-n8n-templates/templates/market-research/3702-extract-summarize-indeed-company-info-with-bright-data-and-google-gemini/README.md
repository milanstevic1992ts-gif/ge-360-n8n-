## Description

### Who this is for?
Extract & Summarize Indeed Company Info is an automated workflow that extracts the Indeed company profile information using Bright Data Web Unlocker, transform it using Google Gemini’s LLM, and forward the transformed response with the summary to a specified webhook for downstream use.

### What problem is this workflow solving?

This workflow solves this by:

- Automating the extraction of company details from Indeed using Bright Data Web Unlocker.

- Summarizing the raw data using Google Gemini's language model for a quick, human-readable overview.

- Sending the transformed response with the summary to a chosen endpoint, like Slack, Notion, Airtable, or a custom webhook.
