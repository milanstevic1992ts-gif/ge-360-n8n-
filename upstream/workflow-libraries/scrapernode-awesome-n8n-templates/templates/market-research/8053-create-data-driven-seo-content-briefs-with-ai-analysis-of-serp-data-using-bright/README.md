> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

This workflow is your all-in-one **AI Content Strategist**, designed to generate comprehensive, data-driven **content briefs** by analyzing top-ranking competitors.

It operates through a simple **chat interface**. 

You provide a target **keyword**, and the workflow automates the entire research process. First, it scrapes the **top 10 Google search results** using the powerful **[Bright Data SERP API](https://get.brightdata.com/unstoppable)**.

Then, for each of those results, it performs a deep dive, using the **Bright Data Web Unblocker** to reliably extract the full content from each page, bypassing any **anti-bot measures**.

Finally, all the gathered data—titles, headings, word counts, and page summaries—is synthesized by a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to produce a **strategic content plan**. 

This plan identifies **search intent**, **core topics**, and crucial **content gaps**, giving you a clear roadmap to **outrank the competition**. This template is indispensable for **SEO specialists**, **content marketers**, and **digital agencies** looking to scale their content production with strategies that are proven to work.

## How It Works

1.  **Chat Interaction Begins**: The workflow is initiated via a **chat UI**. The user enters a target **keyword** to start the analysis.
2.  **Google SERP Scraping (Bright Data)**: The "**Google SERP**" node uses **Bright Data's SERP API** to fetch the **top 10 organic results**, providing the URLs for the next stage.
3.  **Individual Page Scraping (Bright Data)**: The workflow loops through each URL. The "**Access and extract data**" node uses the **Bright Data Web Unblocker** to ensure **successful and complete HTML scraping** of every competitor's page.
4.  **Content Extraction & Aggregation**: A series of `Code` nodes **clean the raw HTML** and **extract structured data** (title, meta description, headings, word count). The `Aggregate` node then **compiles the data** from all 10 pages into a single dataset.
5.  **AI Synthesis (OpenRouter)**: The "**Analysis**" node sends the entire compiled dataset to an **LLM** via **OpenRouter**. The **AI** performs a **holistic analysis** to identify **search intent**, **must-cover topics**, and **differentiation opportunities**.
6.  **Strategic Brief Generation**: The "**Format Output**" node takes the AI's structured **JSON analysis** and transforms it into a clean, human-readable **Markdown report**, which is then delivered back to the user in the chat interface.
