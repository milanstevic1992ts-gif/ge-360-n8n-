## Description

This workflow automates company research and intelligence extraction from Glassdoor using Decode API for data retrieval and Google Gemini for AI-powered summarization.

## Who this is for

This workflow is ideal for:

* Recruiters, analysts, and market researchers looking for structured insights from company profiles.
* HR tech developers and AI research teams needing a reliable way to extract and summarize Glassdoor data automatically.
* Venture analysts or due diligence teams conducting company research combining structured and unstructured content.
* Anyone who wants instant summaries and insights from Glassdoor company pages without manual scraping.


## What problem this workflow solves

* **Manual Data Extraction**: Glassdoor company details and reviews are often scattered and inconsistent, requiring time-consuming copy-paste efforts.
* **Unstructured Insights**: Raw reviews contain valuable opinions but are not organized for analytical use.
* **Fragmented Company Data**: Key metrics like ratings, pros/cons, and FAQs are mixed with irrelevant data.
* **Need for AI Summarization**: Business users need a concise, executive-level summary that combines employee sentiment, culture, and overall performance metrics.

This workflow automates data mining, summarization, and structuring, transforming Glassdoor data into ready-to-use JSON and Markdown summaries.


## What this workflow does

The workflow automates the **end-to-end pipeline** for Glassdoor company research:

1. **Trigger**

   * Start manually by clicking **“Execute Workflow.”**

2. **Set Input Fields**

   * Define `company_url` (e.g., a Glassdoor company profile link) and `geo` (country).

3. **Extract Raw Data from Glassdoor (Decodo Node)**

   * Uses the **Decodo API** to fetch company data — including overview, ratings, reviews, and frequently asked questions.

4. **Generate Structured Data (Google Gemini + Output Parser)**

   * The **Structured Data Extractor** node (powered by Gemini AI) processes raw data into well-defined fields:

     * Company overview (name, size, website, type)
     * Ratings breakdown
     * Review snippets (pros, cons, roles)
     * FAQs
     * Key takeaways

5. **Summarize the Insights (Gemini AI Summarizer)**

   * Produces a detailed summary highlighting:

     * Company reputation
     * Work culture
     * Employee sentiment trends
     * Strengths and weaknesses
     * Hiring recommendations

6. **Merge and Format**

   * Combines structured data and summary into a unified object for output.

7. **Export and Save**

   * Converts the final report into JSON and writes it to disk as
     `C:\{{CompanyName}}.json`.

8. **Binary Encoding for File Handling**

   * Prepares data in base64 for easy integration with APIs or downloadable reports.
