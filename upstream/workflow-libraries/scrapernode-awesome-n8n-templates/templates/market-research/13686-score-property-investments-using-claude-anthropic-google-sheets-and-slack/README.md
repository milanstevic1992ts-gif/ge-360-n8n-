> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

This workflow scrapes property listings, enriches them with market data, and uses Claude AI to score each listing's investment potential based on rental yield, capital growth trends, location desirability, and risk factors.

### How it works

1. **Trigger** - Scheduled run initiates a scrape job
2. **Scrape Listings** - Fetches property listings from target URL(s) via HTTP
3. **Parse Listings** - Extracts structured data (price, bedrooms, suburb, etc.)
4. **Fetch Market Data** - Pulls suburb median prices, rental yields, vacancy rates
5. **Fetch Demographics** - Gets population growth, income levels, infrastructure data
6. **Combine Enrichment** - Merges all data per listing
7. **AI Investment Scoring** - Claude AI scores each listing (0–100) with rationale
8. **Filter Top Picks** - Keeps listings above configurable score threshold
9. **Format Report** - Builds a clean investment report
10. **Save to Google Sheets** - Logs all scored listings for tracking
11. **Send Digest** - Posts top picks to Slack or email

### Setup Steps

1. Import workflow into n8n
