# Amazon Competitive Gap & Assortment Intelligence Workflow

## Description
This workflow automatically scrapes competitor product data from Amazon and identifies gaps in your assortment, pricing, and positioning.  
It helps merchandising and product teams spot opportunities they are missing before competitors fill them.

## Overview
This workflow uses Bright Data to scrape Amazon product pages, then normalizes the data and feeds it to AI for competitive gap analysis.  

It identifies:
- Missing product variants  
- Bundle expansion ideas  
- Positioning gaps  
- Pricing weaknesses  

Each opportunity is scored and prioritized — high-impact gaps are routed to dedicated sheets, while standard opportunities are logged separately.  

All results are sent to Google Sheets dashboards for structured decision-making.

## Tools Used

- **Bright Data**: Scrapes Amazon product data at scale without getting blocked
