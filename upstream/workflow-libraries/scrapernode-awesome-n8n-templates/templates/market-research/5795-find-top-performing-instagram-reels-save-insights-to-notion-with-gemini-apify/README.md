> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*

This template helps you discover trending Instagram Reels from competitors or any public profiles you choose. 

### 📺 How It Works 

The workflow automatically monitors selected Instagram accounts using Apify, pulls recent Reels, and analyzes their performance.  

It calculates engagement levels, detects early “hot” content, translates text if needed, and organizes all results into a structured Notion database — ready for review and production.

I've recorded a video walkthrough to show you how the system works in detail.

- Modify Notion fields or adapt to your own database structure  
- Add more parsing logic to `Variables`  
- Switch translation language

Each part of the workflow is clearly labeled and editable — feel free to adapt it to your goals.
