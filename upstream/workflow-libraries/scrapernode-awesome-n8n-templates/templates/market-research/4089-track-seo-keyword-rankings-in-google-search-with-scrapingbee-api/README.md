## What problem does this workflow solve?

Scraping and formatting Google search results for SEO insights is often manual, repetitive, and error-prone or requires expensive software. Professionals frequently face challenges like:

* Collecting live, structured data from Google for multiple keywords
* Converting raw search results into readable reports for clients or stakeholders
* Logging changes in rankings or URLs across time for historical tracking
* Exporting SEO data into spreadsheets for deeper analysis
* High monthly software fees

## What this workflow does

This n8n workflow scrapes the top organic Google search results for a given keyword and automatically creates a downloadable report while also logging the results in a table format for long-term storage or further processing.

Here’s what it includes:

* A trigger form that accepts a search keyword from the user
* An automated API call to fetch Google’s SERP data
* Two output formats: a formatted **HTML table** for emails and a **Markdown table** for download (e.g., for Excel, Airtable or Google Sheets)
* Automatic CSV file generation for download
* Optional email delivery of the report

## Setup

Getting started is simple:

1. **Enter your API key**

   * Add your API key to the “Scrape Google SERPs” HTTP Request node (Step-by-step guide inside the template)
   * Replace the default query with your own custom Google search parameters if needed

2. **Set up delivery options**

   * Update your email in the “Mail SEO Report” node for report delivery
   * Use the downloadable file output from the “Convert to File” node
   * Optional: Add a Google Sheets (or similar) node which imports the file

3. **Test the workflow**

   * Use the built-in form to input a keyword
   * Confirm that results appear in both your email and downloadable file

4. **Activate the workflow**

   * Turn on the trigger so your team or clients can submit keywords at any time

## How to customize this workflow

This template is easy to extend for a variety of SEO automation needs:

* Add a loop to handle multiple keywords at once
* Connect to Airtable, Notion or Google Sheets
* Integrate with Slack or Discord for notifications
* Apply additional filtering to track only new or changed search results
* Schedule it to run daily or weekly with a cron trigger

By combining live SERP scraping, report formatting, and spreadsheet integration, this workflow gives you a fast and flexible SEO reporting system you can use right away or scale up as needed.
