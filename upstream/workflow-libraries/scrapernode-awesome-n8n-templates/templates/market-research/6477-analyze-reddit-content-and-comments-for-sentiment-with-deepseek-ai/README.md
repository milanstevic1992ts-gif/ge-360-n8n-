## Workflow Nodes Explanation

### Data Collection Nodes
- **Webhook**: Receives API requests with subreddit and analysis parameters
- **Get many posts**: Fetches recent posts from the specified subreddit
- **Split Out**: Processes individual posts for analysis
- **Get many comments in a post**: Retrieves comments for each post

### Processing Nodes
- **Loop Over Items**: Manages batch processing of multiple posts
- **Sentiment Analyzer**: Primary AI analysis node that processes content
- **Structured Data Generator**: Formats AI output into structured JSON
- **Code**: Parses and cleans the AI response
- **Respond to Webhook**: Returns the final analysis results

## Customization Options

### Adjusting Analysis Depth
- Modify the `limit` parameters to analyze more or fewer posts/comments
- Update the AI prompts to focus on specific aspects (e.g., product mentions, competitor analysis)

### Adding Data Storage
- Connect database nodes to store analysis results for historical tracking
- Add email notifications for high-priority findings

### Integrating with Other Tools
- Connect to Slack/Discord for real-time alerts
- Link to Google Sheets for easy data visualization
- Integrate with CRM systems for customer feedback tracking

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Choose Relevant Subreddits**: Focus on communities where your target audience is active
2. **Monitor Regularly**: Set up scheduled executions to track sentiment trends over time
3. **Customize Prompts**: Tailor the AI prompts to your specific industry or use case
4. **Respect Rate Limits**: Reddit API has rate limits, so avoid excessive requests
5. **Review AI Output**: Periodically check the AI analysis accuracy and adjust prompts as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Reddit API Authentication Failed"**
- Verify your Reddit app credentials are correct
- Ensure your redirect URI matches your n8n instance
- Check that your Reddit app is set as "web app" type

**"OpenRouter API Error"**
- Confirm your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- Check that the selected model is available
- Verify your account has access to the chosen model

**"Webhook Not Responding"**
- Ensure the workflow is activated
- Check that the webhook URL is correct
- Verify the request payload format matches the expected structure

**"AI Analysis Returns Errors"**
- Review the prompt formatting in the Structured Data Generator
- Check if the selected AI model supports the required features
- Ensure the input data is not empty or malformed

## Performance Considerations

- **Rate Limits**: Reddit allows 60 requests per minute for OAuth applications
- **AI Costs**: Monitor your OpenRouter usage to manage costs
- **Processing Time**: Larger batches will take longer to process
- **Memory Usage**: Consider n8n instance resources when processing large datasets

## Contributing

This workflow can be extended and improved. Consider adding:
- Support for multiple subreddits in a single request
- Historical sentiment tracking and trend analysis
- Integration with visualization tools
- Custom classification models for industry-specific analysis
