This workflow automates brand intelligence analysis across AI-powered search results by combining **SE Ranking’s AI Search data** with structured processing in n8n.

It retrieves real AI-generated prompts, answers, and cited sources where a brand appears, then normalizes and consolidates this data into a clean, structured format.
