> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

## Description

# Monitor competitor ad activity via Telegram using BrowserAct & Gemini

Turn your Telegram bot into a covert marketing intelligence tool. This workflow allows you to send a company name to a bot, which then scrapes active ad campaigns, analyzes the strategy using AI, and delivers a strategic verdict directly to your chat.

## Target Audience
Digital marketers, dropshippers, e-commerce business owners, and ad agencies looking to track competitor activity without manual searching.

## How it works
1. **Receive Command**: The workflow starts when you send a message to your Telegram bot (e.g., "Check ads for Nike" or "Spy on Higgsfield").
2. **Extract Brand**: An **AI Agent** (using Google Gemini) processes the natural language text to extract the specific company or brand name.
3. **Scrape Ad Data**: A **BrowserAct** node executes a background task (using the "Competitor Ad Activity Monitor" template) to search ad libraries (like Facebook or Google) for active campaigns.
4. **Analyze Strategy**: A second **AI Agent** acts as a "Senior Marketing Analyst." It reviews the scraped data to count active ads, identify key hooks, and determine if the competitor is scaling or inactive.
5. **Deliver Report**: The bot sends a formatted HTML scorecard to **Telegram**, including the ad count, best ad copy, and a strategic verdict (e.g., "ADVERTISE NOW" or "WAIT").

## How to set up
1. **Configure Credentials**: Connect your **Telegram**, **BrowserAct**, and **Google Gemini** accounts in n8n.
2. **Prepare BrowserAct**: Ensure the **Competitor Ad Activity Monitor** template is saved in your BrowserAct account.
3. **Configure Telegram**: Ensure your bot is created via BotFather and the API token is added to the Telegram credentials.
4. **Activate**: Turn on the workflow.
5. **Test**: Send a company name to your bot to generate a report.

## Requirements
* **BrowserAct** account with the **Competitor Ad Activity Monitor** template.
* **Telegram** account (Bot Token).
* **Google Gemini** account.

## How to customize the workflow
1. **Adjust Analysis Logic**: Modify the system prompt in the **Generate response** agent to change how the "Verdict" is calculated (e.g., prioritize video ads over image ads).
2. **Add More Sources**: Update the BrowserAct template to scrape TikTok Creative Center or LinkedIn Ads.
3. **Change Output**: Replace the Telegram output with a **Slack** or **Discord** node to send reports to a team channel.
