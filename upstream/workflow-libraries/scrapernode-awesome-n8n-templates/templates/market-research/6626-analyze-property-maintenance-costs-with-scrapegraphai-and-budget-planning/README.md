> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*

# How it works

This workflow automatically analyzes property maintenance costs by scraping contractor websites and provides comprehensive budget planning and recommendations.

## Key Steps

1. **Scheduled Trigger** - Runs weekly to update maintenance cost data from multiple sources.
2. **Multi-Source Scraping** - Uses ScrapeGraphAI to extract service data from plumbing, electrical, and HVAC contractor websites.
3. **Cost Analysis** - JavaScript nodes process and categorize services by price level and urgency.
4. **Service Comparison** - Compares providers within each category to find best-rated and most cost-effective options.
5. **Budget Planning** - Creates annual budget with quarterly breakdown and service scheduling recommendations.
6. **Property Manager Alerts** - Formats comprehensive reports with budget summaries and actionable recommendations.

## Set up steps

**Setup time: 10-15 minutes**

1. **Configure ScrapeGraphAI credentials** - Add your ScrapeGraphAI API key for web scraping.
2. **Customize contractor websites** - Update the URLs in the scraping nodes to target specific local contractor directories.
3. **Adjust schedule frequency** - Modify the trigger timing based on how often you want cost updates.
4. **Review budget parameters** - Customize the budget planning logic in the JavaScript nodes if needed.
5. **Test the workflow** - Run manually first to ensure all scraping and analysis nodes work correctly.
