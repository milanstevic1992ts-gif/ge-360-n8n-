> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*

# Description
This n8n workflow automatically **scrapes Airbnb listings** from a specified location and **saves the data to a Google Sheet**. It performs pagination to collect listings across multiple pages, extracts detailed information for each property, and organizes the data in a structured format for easy analysis.

# How it Works
The workflow operates through these high-level steps:

- Search Initialization: Starts with an Airbnb search for a specific location (London) with defined check-in/check-out dates and guest count
- Pagination Loop: Automatically processes multiple pages of search results using cursor-based pagination
- Data Extraction: Parses listing information including names, prices, ratings, reviews, and URLs
- Detail Enhancement: Fetches additional details for each listing (house rules, highlights, descriptions, amenities)
- Data Storage: Saves all collected data to a Google Sheet with proper formatting
- Loop Control: Continues until reaching the page limit (2 pages) or no more results are available
