# 📊 Telegram bot: extract & store TikTok and LinkedIn data to Google Sheets with Dumpling AI

> ⚡ **201 views** · 📊 [Market Research & Insights](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

### Who's it for
This workflow is perfect for marketers, social media managers, recruiters, sales teams, and researchers who need to collect and organize public profile data from TikTok and LinkedIn. Whether you're building influencer databases, enriching CRM data, conducting competitor research, or gathering prospect information, this workflow automates the entire data extraction and storage process.

### What it does
This AI-powered Telegram bot automatically scrapes public profile data from TikTok and LinkedIn, then saves it directly to Google Sheets. Simply send a TikTok username or LinkedIn profile URL via text or voice message, and the workflow handles everything:

**For TikTok profiles:**
- Username and verification status
- Follower, following, and friend counts
- Total hearts (likes) and video count
- Bio link and secure user ID

**For LinkedIn profiles:**
- Full name and profile picture
- Location and follower count
- Bio/about section
- Recent posts activity link

All data is automatically organized into separate Google Sheets tabs for easy reference and analysis. You receive an email notification when extraction is complete.

### How it works
The workflow uses an AI Agent as an intelligent router that determines which platform to scrape based on your input. Here's the flow:

1. **Input Processing:** Send a message via Telegram (text or voice)
2. **Voice Transcription:** If you send a voice note, OpenAI Whisper transcribes it to text
3. **AI Routing:** The agent identifies whether it's TikTok or LinkedIn
4. **Profile Scraping:** Calls Dumpling AI's specialized scraper for that platform
5. **Data Extraction:** Parses the profile metrics and details
6. **Database Storage:** Saves all data to the appropriate Google Sheets tab
7. **Confirmation:** Sends an email notification when complete

The AI agent ensures proper tool pairing - it always scrapes first, then saves, preventing partial data or errors.

- Telegram Bot Token (create via @BotFather)
