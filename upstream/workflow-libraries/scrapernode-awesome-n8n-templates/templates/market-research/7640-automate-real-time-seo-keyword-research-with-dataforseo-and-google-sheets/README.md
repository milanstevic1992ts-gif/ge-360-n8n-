## Description

### This n8n template automates real-time SEO keyword research, delivering comprehensive keyword insights, autocomplete suggestions, subtopics, SERP analysis, and more, straight into your Google Sheet.

Use cases are many: This workflow is perfect for bloggers, SEO professionals, affiliate marketers, e-commerce teams, and content creators who need fresh, actionable keyword data for planning, optimization, and content expansion - without endless manual research.

## How It Works
### Phase 1: Set Google Sheet ID & Input Target Keywords
- In n8n, enter the **Google Sheet ID** in the **Set Sheet ID** node. 
- In the connected Google Sheet, for the first tab **Main Keyword**, you manually add the main keywords that you want the tool to research and generate relevant keyword suggestions for. 
- Trigger the process by clicking **Test Workflow** or **Execute Workflow**.
- The workflow automatically reads your main keywords from the **Main Keyword** tab in your linked Google Sheet, only those marked with the status **Ready** will be processed.

### Phase 2: Automated Research & Data Collection
For your input main keyword (considering here you only set **Ready** for one main keyword in the connected Google Sheet), the workflow runs multiple automated queries in parallel:

**1. Get Related Keywords:**

- The workflow sends a **POST request** to the **DataForSEO API** endpoint to directly retrieve an array of related keywords.
- Then, the array of related keywords is parsed out, preparing each keyword as a separate record for further processing.
- It appends each extracted related keyword as a new row in the **Related KW** tab of your connected Google Sheet. The **Main Keyword** value from your input is included in **Column A** of the tab to maintain keyword context.
- Additionally, the workflow appends the related keywords  - along with the associated main keyword - to the **All Results** tab in your Google Sheet for consolidated tracking and future reference. This ensures you have both a dedicated list of related keywords and a master log of all research results in one place.


**2. Get Keyword Suggestions:**

- The workflow sends a **POST request** to the **DataForSEO API** endpoint to directly retrieve an array of keyword suggestions related to your main keyword.
- This array of keyword suggestions is then parsed, splitting out each suggestion as an individual record for further processing.
- Each extracted keyword suggestion is appended as a new row in the **KW Suggestion** tab of your connected Google Sheet. The original **Main Keyword** value from your input is included in Column A of the tab to maintain clear context.
- Additionally, the workflow appends all keyword suggestions - along with the associated main keyword - to the **All Results** tab in your Google Sheet for consolidated tracking and future reference. This ensures you have both a dedicated list of keyword suggestions and a master log of all research results in one place.


**3. Get Autocomplete Suggestions:**

- The workflow sends a **POST request** to the **DataForSEO API** endpoint to retrieve Google autocomplete keyword suggestions for your main keyword.
- The array of autocomplete keyword suggestions is parsed out as an individual record for processing.
- Each extracted autocomplete keyword is appended as a new row in the **Autocomplete Suggestion** tab of your connected Google Sheet. The Main Keyword is included alongside each entry for proper tracking.
- Additionally, the workflow appends all autocomplete keywords - along with the associated main keyword - to the **All Results** tab in your Google Sheet for consolidated tracking and future reference. This ensures you have both a dedicated list of autocomplete keywords and a master log of all research results in one place.


**4. Get Content Ideas:**

- The workflow sends a **POST request** to the DataForSEO API endpoint to retrieve content ideas and fresh topic suggestions based on your main keyword.
- The array of content ideas is then parsed; each idea is extracted as a separate record for further use.
- Every content idea is then appended as a new row in the **Content Idea** tab of your connected Google Sheet, with the Main Keyword included to provide context.
- Additionally, the workflow appends all content ideas, along with their related main keyword, to the **All Results** tab in your sheet for consolidated tracking and easy access. This ensures you have both a dedicated list of content ideas for brainstorming and a central log of all keyword research outputs in one place.


**5. Get SERPs:**

- The workflow sends a **POST request** to the DataForSEO API endpoint, retrieving both the current Google SERP (Search Engine Results Page) data and People Also Ask (PAA) questions related to your main keyword.
- Then, the data is split into two streams: one for standard SERP results and one for PAA questions.
- For Standard SERPs:
     + The workflow filters the SERP data to keep only the most relevant results.
     + Each SERP entry is appended as a new row in the **SERP** tab of your connected Google Sheet, providing insights into top-ranking pages and their attributes.
- For PAA (People Also Ask):
     + The PAA data is also filtered.
     + Each PAA question is split out and added as a new row in the **PAA** tab in your connected Google Sheet for focused tracking.
     + Additionally, all PAA questions are consolidated and appended, along with their related main keyword, to the **All Results** tab in your sheet for consolidated tracking and easy access. This ensures you have both a dedicated list of PAA questions for brainstorming and a central log of all research outputs in one place.
