# 📊 Extract LinkedIn post engagement data with Airtop

> ⚡ **1,113 views** · 📊 [Market Research & Insights](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

# LinkedIn Post Engagement Data Extractor

## Use Case
This automation is designed to extract key engagement metrics and audience data from a LinkedIn post. It's useful for analyzing the impact of content and identifying engaged users for lead generation, marketing, or research purposes.

## What It Does
Given a LinkedIn post URL and an Airtop profile, this automation extracts:

- Total number of reactions
- Total number of comments
- Total number of reposts
- A list of users who reacted or commented, including:
  - Their full name
  - Their job title
  - A link to their LinkedIn profile

## Input Parameters

| Name             | Description                                                | Required |
