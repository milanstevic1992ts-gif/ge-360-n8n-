## Description

## Sync Youtube Videos with Google Sheets
**(Part 1 of Youtube comments sentiment analyze automation along with detailed dashboard)**

This workflow is the **first part of a multi-part automation system** designed to perform large-scale YouTube comment sentiment analysis alongwith detailed dashboard. It solves the problem of manually tracking new videos across multiple YouTube channels by automatically fetching and organizing video URLs in a Google Sheet, setting the stage for deeper analysis in Part 2.

### What It Does
1. **Reads Channel IDs** from `Sheet3` of a connected Google Sheet.
2. **Fetches the latest videos** from each Channel ID using the **YouTube Data API**.
3. **Extracts video URLs and metadata** (like title and publish date).
4. **Appends the video data** to `Sheet2` of the same Google Sheet — this sheet is later used by Part 2 for further processing.

### Part of a Multi-Step System
This is **Part 1** of a 2-workflow system:
- **Part 1 (this workflow)** populates a sheet with the latest videos from a list of channels.
- **Part 2** reads the video URLs from `Sheet2`, fetches comments for each video, analyzes their sentiment using **OpenAI**, and stores structured results in `Sheet1`.
