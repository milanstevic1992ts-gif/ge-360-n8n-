## Description

### Who this is for
The TrustPilot SaaS Product Review Tracker is designed for product managers, SaaS growth teams, customer experience analysts, and marketing teams who need to extract, summarize, and analyze customer feedback at scale from TrustPilot.

This workflow is tailored for:

- **Product Managers** - Monitoring feedback to drive feature improvements

- **Customer Support & CX Teams** - Identifying sentiment trends or recurring issues

- **Marketing & Growth Teams** - Leveraging testimonials and market perception

- **Data Analysts** - Tracking competitor reviews and benchmarking

- **Founders & Executives** - Wanting aggregated insights into customer satisfaction

### What problem is this workflow solving?
Manually monitoring, extracting, and summarizing TrustPilot reviews is time-consuming, fragmented, and hard to scale across multiple SaaS products. 

This workflow automates that process from unlocking the data behind anti-bot layers to summarizing and storing customer insights enabling teams to respond faster, spot trends, and make data-backed product decisions.

This workflow solves:

- The challenge of scraping protected review data (using Bright Data Web Unlocker)

- The need for structured insights from unstructured review content

- The lack of automated delivery to storage and alerting systems like Google Sheets or webhooks

### What this workflow does
**Extract TrustPilot Reviews**: Uses Bright Data Web Unlocker to bypass anti-bot protections and pull markdown-based content from product review pages

**Convert Markdown to Text**: Leverages a basic LLM chain to clean and convert scraped markdown into plain text

**Structured Information Extraction**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4o via the Information Extractor node to extract fields like product name, review date, rating, and reviewer sentiment

**Summarization Chain**: Generates concise summaries of overall review sentiment and themes using OpenAI

**Merge & Aggregate Output**: Consolidates individual extracted records into a structured batch output

**Outbound Data Delivery**:

- Google Sheets – Appends summary and structured review data

- Write to Disk – Persists raw and processed content locally

- Webhook Notification – Sends a real-time alert with summarized insights
