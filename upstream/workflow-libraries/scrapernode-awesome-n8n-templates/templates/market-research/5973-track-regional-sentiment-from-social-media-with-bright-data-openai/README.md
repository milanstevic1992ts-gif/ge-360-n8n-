> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*

This workflow automatically tracks regional sentiment across social media and news outlets, giving you a real-time pulse on how people in a specific area feel about your brand or topic.

## Overview

The automation queries Twitter, Reddit, and major news APIs filtered by geolocation. Bright Data handles location-specific scraping where APIs are limited. OpenAI performs sentiment and keyword extraction, aggregating scores into a daily report stored in Google Sheets and visualized in Data Studio.

## Tools Used

- **n8n** – Coordinates all steps
- **Bright Data** – Collects geo-targeted data beyond API limits
- **OpenAI** – Runs sentiment analysis and topic modeling
- **Google Sheets** – Houses cleaned sentiment metrics
- **Data Studio / Looker** – Optional dashboard for visualization

1. **Import the Workflow** into n8n with the provided `.json`.
2. **Configure Bright Data** credentials.
3. **Set Up OpenAI** API key.
4. **Connect Google Sheets** and create a destination spreadsheet.
