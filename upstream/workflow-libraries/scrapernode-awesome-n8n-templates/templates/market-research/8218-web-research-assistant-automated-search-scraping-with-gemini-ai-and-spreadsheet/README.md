> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This template requires self-hosted n8n hosting due to the use of community nodes (MCP tools). It will not work on n8n Cloud. Make sure you have access to a self-hosted n8n instance before using this template.

## Overview 

![Screenshot 20250905 103811.png](fileId:2317)

This workflow automation allows a **Google Gemini-powered AI Agent** to orchestrate multi-source web intelligence using **MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools** such as Firecrawl, Brave Search, and Apify.

The system allows users to interact with the agent in natural language, which then leverages various external data collection tools, processes the results, and automatically organizes them into structured spreadsheets.

With built-in memory, flexible tool execution, and conversational capabilities, this workflow acts as a **multi-agent research assistant**, capable of retrieving, synthesizing, and delivering actionable insights in real time.

## How the system works

### AI Agent + MCP Pipeline

1. **User Interaction**
   A chat message is received and forwarded to the AI Agent.

2. **AI Orchestration**
   The agent, powered by **Google Gemini**, decides which MCP tools to invoke based on the query.

   * **Firecrawl-MCP**: Recursive web crawling and content extraction.
   * **Brave-MCP**: Real-time web search with structured results.
   * **Apify-MCP**: Automation of web scraping tasks with scalable execution.

3. **Memory Management**
   A memory module stores context across conversations, ensuring multi-turn reasoning and task continuity.

4. **Spreadsheet automation**
   Results are structured in a new, automatically created Google Spreadsheet, enriched with formatting and additional metadata.

5. **Data processing**
   The workflow generates the spreadsheet content, updates the sheet, and improves results via HTTP requests and field edits.

6. **Delivery of results**
   Users receive a structured and contextualized dataset ready for review, analysis, or integration into other systems.

## Configuration instructions

**Estimated setup time:** 45 minutes

### Prerequisites

* Self-hosted n8n instance (v0.200.0 or higher recommended)
* Google Gemini API key
* MCP-compatible nodes (Firecrawl, Brave, Apify) configured
* Google Sheets credentials for spreadsheet automation

## Detailed configuration steps

### Step 1: Configuring the AI Agent

* **AI Agent node**: 
  - Select **Google Gemini** as the LLM model
  - Configure your Google Gemini API key in the n8n credentials
  - Set the system prompt to guide the agent's behavior
  - Connect the **Simple Memory** node to enable context tracking

### Step 2: Integrating MCP Tools

* **Firecrawl-MCP Configuration**:
  - Install the `@n8n/n8n-nodes-firecrawl-mcp` package
  - Configure your Firecrawl API key
  - Set crawling parameters (depth, CSS selectors)

* **Brave-MCP configuration**:
  - Install the `@n8n/n8n-nodes-brave-mcp` package
  - Add your Brave Search API key
  - Configure search filters (region, language, SafeSearch)

* **Apify-MCP configuration**:
  - Install the `@n8n/n8n-nodes-apify-mcp` package
  - Configure your Apify credentials
  - Select the appropriate actors for your use cases

### Step 3: Spreadsheet automation

* **“Create Spreadsheet” node**:
  - Configure Google Sheets authentication (OAuth2 or Service Account)
  - Set the file name with dynamic timestamps
  - Specify the destination folder in Google Drive

* **“Generate Spreadsheet Content” node**:
  - Transform the agent's outputs into tabular format
  - Define the columns: URL, Title, Description, Source, Timestamp
  - Configure data formatting (dates, links, metadata)

* **“Update Spreadsheet” node**:
  - Insert the data into the created sheet
  - Apply automatic formatting (headers, colors, column widths)
  - Add summary formulas if necessary

### Step 4: Post-processing and delivery

* **“Data Enrichment Request” node** (formerly “HTTP Request1”):
  - Configure optional API calls to enrich the data
  - Add additional metadata (geolocation, sentiment, categorization)
  - Manage errors and timeouts

* **“Edit Fields” node**:
  - Refine the final dataset (metadata, tags, filters)
  - Clean and normalize the data
  - Prepare the final response for the user
## Structure of generated Google Sheets

### Default columns
| Column | Description | Type |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **URL** | Data source URL | Hyperlink |
| **Title** | Page/resource title | Text |
| **Description** | Description or content excerpt | Long text |
| **Source** | MCP tool used (Brave/Firecrawl/Apify) | Text |
| **Timestamp** | Date/time of collection | Date/Time |
| **Metadata** | Additional data (JSON) | Text |

### Automatic formatting
* **Headings**: Bold font, colored background
* **URLs**: Formatted as clickable links
* **Dates**: Standardized ISO 8601 format
* **Columns**: Width automatically adjusted to content
