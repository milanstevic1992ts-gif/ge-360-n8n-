### How it works
This workflow automates the entire process of collecting, analyzing, and reporting customer feedback from Feedaty. 

It starts by scraping live reviews from a specified company's Feedaty page using ScrapeGraphAI, extracting review details like date, rating, and text. Each review is then individually analyzed for sentiment (Positive, Neutral, or Negative) using an AI model.

All processed reviews are aggregated and passed to a specialized AI agent that performs a comprehensive company-level reputation analysis, generating a structured management report. 

Finally, the report is converted into an HTML/PDF format and uploaded to a designated Google Drive folder, creating a fully automated pipeline from data collection to actionable insights delivery.

### Set up steps
1. **Configure Parameters:** Set the Feedaty company identifier (e.g., `maxisport`) and the maximum number of review pages to scrape in the "Set Parameters" node.
2. **API Credentials:** Ensure the following credentials are configured in n8n:
   - [ScrapeGraphAI API](https://dashboard.scrapegraphai.com/?via=n3witalia) (for web scraping)
   - Google Gemini API (for AI sentiment analysis and report generation)
   - Google Drive OAuth2 (for file upload)
   - [ConvertAPI](https://convertapi.com?ref=n3witalia) (for HTML to PDF conversion)
3. **Customize Output:** Optionally adjust the "Limit reviews" node to control the number of reviews processed and modify the AI agent's system prompt in "Company Reputation Management" to tailor the report format.
4. **Destination Folder:** Verify the Google Drive folder ID in the "Upload file" node points to the correct destination for the generated reports.
5. **Execution:** Trigger the workflow manually via the "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" node to run the complete scraping, analysis, and reporting pipeline.
