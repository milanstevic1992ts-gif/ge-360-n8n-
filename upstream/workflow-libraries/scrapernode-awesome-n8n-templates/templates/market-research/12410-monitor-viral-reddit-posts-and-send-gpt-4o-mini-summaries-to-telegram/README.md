## How it works

**Step 1: Configuration & Scheduling**

- Fetches the 50 newest posts from each subreddit
- Extracts key data: title, URL, upvotes, timestamp, subreddit name

**Step 3: Smart Filtering**
- Applies viral post criteria:
  - Posts with 500+ upvotes, OR
  - Posts with 70+ upvotes created within the last 24 hours
- Ensures only high-engagement content passes through

**Step 4: AI Summarization**
- Aggregates all filtered posts into a single batch
- Sends to GPT-4o-mini for analysis
- Generates concise 100-200 word summaries
- Formats output for Telegram markdown

**Step 5: Delivery**
