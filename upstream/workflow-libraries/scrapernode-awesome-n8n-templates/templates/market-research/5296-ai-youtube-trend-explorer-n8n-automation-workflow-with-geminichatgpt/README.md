> 💡 **Pro Tip** — YouTube's API quotas can be a bottleneck when you're pulling data at scale. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/youtube) is a community node with dedicated scrapers for [channels](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/channels), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/videos), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/comments) — no quota limits, just structured data.

## Description

### This n8n template helps you automatically discover, analyze, and track trending topics and videos on YouTube using an AI-powered agent.

Use cases are many: This workflow is perfect for **YouTube creators** needing fresh video ideas, **digital marketers** scouting new campaign topics, **social media managers** who want to catch trends early, and **researchers** who want to analyze what’s viral.

## How It Works
- The workflow starts whenever a chat message is received (e.g., a trend question, a topic prompt, or a request for insights).
- Incoming chat is routed to the **AI Agent – Trend Explorer** node:
     + First, the agent triggers the **Workflow – YouTube Search** tool to gather the latest trending topics and keywords from YouTube.
     + Next, the agent supplies this real-time YouTube data to the **OpenAI Chat Model** for deep analysis, trend interpretation, and unique insights.
     + To provide context-aware answers and track ongoing interests, the agent also references a **Simple Memory** module, recalling past queries, and user instructions.
- Finally, the result is a fast, data-driven, and smart trend report delivered instantly to your chat.

## How To Set Up
- Download the workflow package (including 2 .json files) and import it into your n8n interface.
- Set up necessary access in the following components of the **AI Agent - Trend Explorer** node:
    + **OpenAI Chat Model**: allows API connection for trend insights.
    + **Workflow – YouTube Search**: searches for trending videos based on the query.
    + **Simple Memory** (optional): enhances experience for ongoing sessions.
- Start by sending a chat message on n8n.
- Check the response from the AI agent in the same chat box.
- Ask follow-ups, explore deeper, or trigger new searches - all in one chat thread.

## Requirements
- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud).
- Set up API access to **OpenAI Chat Model** for chat-based AI.

## How To Customize
- **Connect to your favorite chat platforms**: Easily integrate with additional chat triggers such as Telegram, Slack, or your preferred messaging app.
- **Choose your preferred AI model**: If you want a different viewpoint, simply swap OpenAI Chat Model for Google Gemini, Claude, or any compatible LLM model in your workflow.
- **Upgrade memory for smarter conversations**: For long-term recall or more advanced, context-aware chats, replace **Simple Memory** with a vector database like Pinecone or Redis.
