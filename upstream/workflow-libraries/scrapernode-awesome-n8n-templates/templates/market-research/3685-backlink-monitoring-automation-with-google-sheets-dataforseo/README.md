> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

## What This Workflow Does

This n8n workflow reads backlinks from a Google Sheet, sends each one to the DataForSEO On-Page API, and checks:

- Whether the backlink is still live on the target page
- Whether it's dofollow or nofollow
- Whether it's missing (i.e., lost)

The result is then written back to the same Google Sheet under a Status column.

## Your result will look like this:
