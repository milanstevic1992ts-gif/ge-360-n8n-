> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

## Product Review Analysis with BrowserAct & Gemini-Powered Recommendations.

### This n8n template demonstrates how to perform product review sentiment analysis and generate improvement recommendations using an AI Agent.

This workflow is perfect for e-commerce store owners, product managers, or marketing teams who want to automate the process of collecting feedback and turning it into actionable insights.

---
### How it works
* The workflow is triggered manually.
* An **HTTP Request** node initiates a web scraping task with the BrowserAct API to collect product reviews.
* A series of **If** and **Wait** nodes are used to check the status of the scraping task. If the task is not yet complete, the workflow pauses and retries until it receives the full dataset.
* An **AI Agent** node, powered by **Google Gemini**, then processes the scraped review summaries. It analyzes the sentiment of each review and generates actionable improvement recommendations.
* Finally, the workflow sends these detailed recommendations via a **Telegram** message and an **Email** to the relevant stakeholders.

---
### Requirements
* **BrowserAct** API account for web scraping
* **BrowserAct** "**Product Review Sentiment Analysis**" Template
* **Gemini** account for the AI Agent
* **Telegram** and **SMTP** credentials for sending messages
