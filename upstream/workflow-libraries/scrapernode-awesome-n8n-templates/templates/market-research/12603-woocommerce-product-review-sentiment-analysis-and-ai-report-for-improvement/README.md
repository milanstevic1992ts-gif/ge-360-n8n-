## Description

This workflow automates the **end-to-end analysis of WooCommerce product reviews**, transforming raw customer feedback into **actionable product and customer-care insights**, and delivering them in a structured, visual, and shareable format.

This workflow analyzes product review sentiment from WooCommerce using AI. It starts by retrieving reviews for a specified product via the WooCommerce. 

Each review then undergoes sentiment analysis using LangChain's Sentiment Analysis. The workflow aggregates sentiment data, creates a pie chart visualization via QuickChart, and compiles a comprehensive report using an AI Agent. 

The report includes executive summaries, quantitative data, qualitative analysis, product diagnostics, and operational recommendations. Finally, the **AI-generated report** is converted to HTML and emailed to a designated recipient for review by customer and product teams.

### How it works

1. **Manual Trigger & Configuration**
   The workflow starts manually and sets the target **WooCommerce product ID** and **store URL**.

2. **Data Retrieval from WooCommerce**

   * Fetches **all reviews** for the selected product via the WooCommerce REST API.
   * Retrieves **product details** (name, description, categories) to enrich the analysis context.

3. **Batch Processing of Reviews**
   Reviews are processed in batches to ensure scalability and reliability, even with a large number of reviews.

4. **AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis**

   * Each review is analyzed using an OpenAI-based sentiment analysis model.
   * For every review, the workflow extracts:

     * Sentiment category (Positive / Negative / Neutral)
     * Strength (intensity)
     * Confidence (reliability of the classification)

5. **Data Normalization & Aggregation**

   * Review text is cleaned and structured.
   * Sentiment data is aggregated to compute overall distributions and metrics.

6. **Visual Sentiment Distribution**

   * A pie chart is dynamically generated via QuickChart to visually represent sentiment distribution.

7. **Advanced AI Insight Generation**
   A specialized AI agent (“Product Insights Analyst”) transforms the raw and aggregated data into a **professional, structured report**, including:

   * Executive summary
   * Quantitative statistics
   * Qualitative themes
   * Product diagnosis
   * Operational recommendations
   * Product backlog ideas
   * Next steps

8. **HTML Conversion & Delivery**

   * The report is converted into clean HTML.
   * The final output is automatically sent via **email** to stakeholders (e.g. product or customer care teams).
