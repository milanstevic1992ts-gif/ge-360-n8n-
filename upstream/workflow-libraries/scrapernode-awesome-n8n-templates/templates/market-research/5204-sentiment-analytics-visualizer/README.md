4. **Builds a doughnut chart** summarising the totals.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to run

1. Drop a few sample reviews into the sheet.
2. Click **“Test workflow”** on the Manual Trigger.
3. Watch each row march through → sentiment appears in column C.
4. After all rows finish, check your inbox for a fresh chart. ✔️

## ✨ Ideas for next level

* **Schedule** the trigger (Cron) to auto-process new reviews daily.
* Feed the counts to **Slack** or **Discord** instead of email.
* Add a second GPT call to generate a short summary for each review.
