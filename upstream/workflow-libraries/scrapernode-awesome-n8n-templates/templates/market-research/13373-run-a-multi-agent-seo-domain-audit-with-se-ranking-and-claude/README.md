# Run a multi-agent SEO domain audit with SE Ranking and Claude

## Who is this for
- SEO agencies running competitor analysis for clients
- Content teams planning editorial strategies
- Marketing teams tracking competitive performance

## What this workflow does
Enter any domain and get a full SEO strategy report. Five AI agents analyze your technical health, backlinks, keywords, AI visibility, and competitors — then a Strategy Director builds a prioritized 90-day action plan.

## What you'll get
- Domain performance baseline (keywords, traffic, traffic value)
- Technical SEO audit with health score and Core Web Vitals
- Backlink profile with anchor text analysis
- Top competitors discovered by keyword overlap
- AI visibility across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and AI Overviews
- Prioritized 90-day action plan from the Strategy Director
