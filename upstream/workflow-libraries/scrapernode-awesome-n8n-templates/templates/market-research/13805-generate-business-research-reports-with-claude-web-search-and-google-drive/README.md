## Description

This workflow is a fully automated AI-powered business intelligence agent. It accepts a research topic or company name via webhook, autonomously collects data from multiple live sources (web search, news feeds, financial APIs), runs a multi-stage Claude AI analysis pipeline, and delivers a structured professional business report — all without human intervention.

### What's the Goal?
To eliminate the hours analysts spend manually gathering data, switching between tools, and writing reports. This workflow does it all in under 3 minutes:
- Collects live market and competitor data
- Pulls recent news and sentiment signals
- Runs deep AI analysis across all sources
- Generates a structured executive report with SWOT, risks, and opportunities
- Delivers the final report via email and saves to Google Drive

### Why Does It Matter?
Manual business research is slow, inconsistent, and expensive. This workflow:
- Saves 4-8 hours of analyst time per report
- Produces consistent, structured outputs every time
- Runs on a schedule or on-demand via API
- Scales to any number of topics or companies
- Integrates directly into your CRM, Slack, or email
- Generates billable deliverables for consulting agencies

### How It Works
**Stage 1 — INTAKE**
Webhook receives a research request. Set node normalizes all inputs and stores credentials. IF node validates the request has a valid topic.

**Stage 2 — DATA COLLECTION (parallel)**
Three HTTP Request nodes run simultaneously:
- Serper.dev fetches top 10 Google results for the topic
- NewsAPI pulls the latest 10 news articles from the past 7 days
- Alpha Vantage fetches financial/market data if a ticker is provided

**Stage 3 — DATA PROCESSING**
Code node merges and cleans all collected data. Extracts headlines, snippets, URLs, publication dates, sentiment signals, and key figures into a structured context object ready for AI analysis.

**Stage 4 — AI ANALYSIS (3-pass Claude pipeline)**
Pass 1 — Research Synthesis: Claude reads all raw data and extracts key facts, trends, and signals
Pass 2 — Strategic Analysis: Claude performs SWOT analysis, identifies risks and opportunities
Pass 3 — Report Generation: Claude writes the final structured executive report in Markdown

**Stage 5 — OUTPUT & DELIVERY**
Report is saved to Google Drive as a document. Summary is posted to Slack. Full report is emailed via SendGrid. All metadata is logged to Google Sheets. Webhook returns JSON response.
