> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*

This workflow automatically monitors local event platforms (Eventbrite, Meetup, Facebook Events) and aggregates upcoming events that match your criteria. Never miss a networking or sponsorship opportunity again.

## Overview

A scheduled trigger scrapes multiple event sites via Bright Data, filtering by location, date range, and keywords. OpenAI classifies each event (conference, meetup, workshop) and extracts key details such as venue, organizers, and ticket price. Updates are posted to Slack and archived in Airtable for quick lookup.

## Tools Used

- **n8n** – Core automation engine
- **Bright Data** – Reliable multi-site scraping
- **OpenAI** – NLP-based event categorization
- **Slack** – Delivers daily event digests
- **Airtable** – Stores enriched event records
