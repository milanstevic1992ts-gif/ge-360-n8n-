# 📊 Extract insights from LinkedIn comments with Apify, Pinecone Assistant, and GPT-4.1

> ⚡ **23 views** · 📊 [Market Research & Insights](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

This n8n workflow template lets you extract insights from comments on your LinkedIn posts using Pinecone Assistant, Apify, and OpenAI. It scrapes LinkedIn comments using Apify and then retrieves relevant context from this data using Pinecone Assistant and generates insights with OpenAI, all without the need to train your own LLM.

### What is Pinecone Assistant?

[Pinecone Assistant](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/assistant/overview) allows you to build production-grade chat and agent-based applications quickly. It abstracts the complexities of implementing retrieval-augmented (RAG) systems by managing the chunking, embedding, storage, query planning, vector search, model orchestration, reranking for you.

### Prerequisites

* A [Pinecone account](https://app.pinecone.io/) and [API key](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/projects/-/keys)
* An [Open AI account](https://auth.openai.com/create-account) and [API key](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys)
* An [Apify account](https://apify.com/) and [API token](https://console.apify.com/settings/integrations)

### Setup

1. Create a Pinecone Assistant in the Pinecone Console [here](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/projects/-/assistant) 
	1. Name your Assistant `n8n-assistant`
	2. No need to configure a Chat model or Assistant instructions
2. Setup Pinecone API key, OpenAI API key, and Apify API token as credentials in n8n
3. In the Set LinkedIn url node, enter your LinkedIn profile url, for a personal or company profile
4. Select your Assistant Name in each of the Pinecone Assistant nodes, if it's not already
5. Schedule or manually execute Step 1 and 2 to extract the LinkedIn comment data and upload to Pinecone Assistant
6. Once the data is uploaded, ask a question in the chat: `Summarize the comments related to [SOME TOPIC YOU TALK ABOUT] and categorize into positive, neutral, and negative.`
