## Description

# 📊 YouTube Trends Workflow in n8n

## 🎯 Goal of the Workflow
This workflow fetches the **most popular YouTube videos in Germany** and transforms them into a **clean list of trending hashtags/keywords**.  
It’s not just raw data – it highlights **qualitative insights** about which topics and keywords drive real engagement.

Useful for:
- **Content creators & marketers** → quick inspiration for viral topics  
- **SEO/hashtag research** → discover high-performing keywords  
- **Social media teams** → automated trend reporting  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works – Step by Step

### 1. **Trigger**
- **Node:** `Manual Trigger`  
- Entry point of the workflow.  
  → Can later be replaced with a Cron or Webhook trigger to run automatically.

---

### 2. **API Call – YouTube**
- **Node:** `HTTP Request`  
- Calls the **YouTube Data API v3** with:
  - `chart=mostPopular`
  - `regionCode=DE`
  - `maxResults=50`  
- Returns a list of trending videos in Germany, including title, channel, views, likes, comments, and tags.

---

### 3. **Split Items**
- **Node:** `Split Out`  
- Splits the API response (`items[]`) into **individual items**, so each video is processed separately.

---

### 4. **Context & KPIs**
- **Node:** `Set`  
- Extracts key fields:
  - `title`, `channel`, `publishedAt`  
  - `views`, `likes`, `comments`  
- Calculates:
  - `engagementRate = (likes + comments) / (views + 1)`  

**Why?**  
Looking at views alone is misleading. Engagement rate reveals which videos truly **resonate with the audience**.

---

### 5. **Ranking & Limit**
- **Node:** `Item Lists`  
- Sorts videos by **highest engagement rate** (descending).  
- Limits results to the **Top 20 videos**.  

**Why?**  
This reduces noise and focuses only on the **most relevant trends**.

---

### 6. **Collect Tags**
- **Node:** `Aggregate`  
- Collects all `snippet.tags` from the top videos.  
- Merges them into a **single keyword list**.  

---

### 7. **Keyword Summary**
- **Node:** `Summarize`  
- Concatenates all collected tags into one string.  

**Result:**  
A **compact hashtag/keyword list** → ready to use for:
- Content ideas  
- SEO/hashtag strategies  
- Social media planning  

---

## 📈 Why This Workflow Is Useful
- **Automated trend analysis**: no need to manually browse YouTube.  
- **Quality focus**: uses engagement rate, not just views.  
- **Reusable**: results can be:
  - stored in Google Sheets or Airtable,  
  - sent to Slack/Telegram,  
  - or used in a dashboard.  

---

## 🚀 Possible Extensions
- **Cron Trigger** → run daily for automated reports.  
- **Notifier** → send results directly to Slack, Discord, or Telegram.  
- **Storage** → save trends in a database for historical analysis.  
- **AI Node** → use GPT to summarize trends into “3 key insights of the day.”  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
With a few smartly combined nodes, this workflow:  
- fetches external API data (YouTube),  
- cleans and enriches it,  
- calculates qualitative KPIs,  
- and delivers actionable **trend insights**.  

Perfect as a **community showcase** or a **practical tool** for creators and marketers.
