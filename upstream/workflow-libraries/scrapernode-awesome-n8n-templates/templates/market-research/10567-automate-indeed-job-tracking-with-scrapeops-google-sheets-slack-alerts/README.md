> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Job boards are notoriously hard to scrape — CAPTCHAs, rate limits, constantly changing layouts. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) has maintained scrapers for [Indeed jobs](https://scrapernode.com/indeed/scrapers/jobs), [Glassdoor reviews](https://scrapernode.com/glassdoor/scrapers/reviews), and [Glassdoor jobs](https://scrapernode.com/glassdoor/scrapers/jobs) that handle all of that for you.

## Description

## Overview
This n8n template automates the process of scraping job listings from Indeed, parsing the data into a structured format, and saving it to Google Sheets for easy tracking. It also includes a Slack notification system to alert you when new jobs are found.

Built with **ScrapeOps**, it handles the complexities of web scraping - such as proxy rotation, anti-bot bypassing, and HTML parsing - so you can focus on the data.

## Who is this for?
- **Job Seekers**: Automate your daily job search and get instant alerts for new postings.
- **Recruiters & HR Agencies**: Track hiring trends and find new leads for candidate placement.
- **Sales & Marketing Teams**: Monitor companies that are hiring to identify growth signals and lead opportunities.
- **Data Analysts**: Gather labor market data for research and competitive analysis.

## What problems it solves
- **Manual Searching**: Eliminates the need to manually refresh Indeed and copy-paste job details.
- **Data Structure**: Converts messy HTML into clean, organized rows in a spreadsheet.
- **Blocking & Captchas**: Uses ScrapeOps residential proxies to bypass Indeed's anti-bot protections reliably.
- **Missed Opportunities**: Automated scheduling ensures you are the first to know about new listings.

## How it works
1. **Trigger**: The workflow runs on a schedule (default: every 6 hours).
2. **Configuration**: You define your search query (e.g., "Software Engineer") in the `Set Search URL` node.
3. **Scraping**: The **ScrapeOps Proxy API** fetches the Indeed search results page using a residential proxy to avoid detection.
4. **Parsing**: The **ScrapeOps Parser API** takes the raw HTML and extracts key details like Job Title, Company, Location, Salary, and URL.
5. **Filtering**: A code node filters out invalid results and structures the data.
6. **Storage**: Valid jobs are appended to a Google Sheet.
7. **Notification**: A message is sent to Slack confirming the update.
