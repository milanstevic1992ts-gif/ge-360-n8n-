> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

### **How it Works**


1.  **Trigger & Data Fetching:** The workflow starts manually. It reads a specified RSS feed and immediately filters the items to keep only those published within the last 24 hours, ensuring the digest is current.

2.  **Content Processing:** For each recent article (up to a limit of 3), the workflow performs a two-step process:
    *   **Scraping:** It visits the article's URL using [ScrapeGraphAI](https://dashboard.scrapegraphai.com/?via=n3witalia) to extract the main content and convert it into clean text.
    *   **Information Extraction:** A Language Model (Google Gemini) analyzes the scraped text to identify and extract the most relevant information, discarding superfluous content like ads or navigation menus.

3.  **Digest Generation & Delivery:** The extracted content from all articles is aggregated. A powerful Language Model (OpenAI) is then instructed to synthesize this information into a well-structured summary with a clear subject and body, formatted as an email. Finally, this generated digest is sent simultaneously to a specified email address via Gmail and to a Telegram channel or chat.

### **Set up Steps**

Before executing the workflow, you need to configure the following steps:

1.  **Install the Community Node:** Install the **ScrapeGraphAI node** from the n8n community nodes list. This node is essential for scraping article content and is not part of the core n8n installation.

2.  **Configure Credentials:** Ensure the following credentials are correctly set up in your n8n instance:
    *   `ScrapegraphAI account`: For the web scraping functionality.
    *   `OpenAi account`: For the summary generation.
    *   `Gmail account`: To send the email.
    *   `Telegram account`: To send the Telegram message.

3.  **Set Key Parameters:** Update the workflow with your specific details:
    *   In the **"RSS Read"** node: Replace `URL_FEED` with the actual URL of the RSS feed you want to monitor.
    *   In the **"Send to Telegram"** node: Replace `YOUR_CHAT_ID` with the unique identifier of your Telegram channel or chat.
