# Qualify and enrich inbound leads with contextual insights and Slack alerts

## Who is this for?
Sales teams, account executives, and RevOps professionals who need more than just basic lead scoring. Built for teams that want deep contextual insights about qualified prospects to enable truly relevant conversations from the first touchpoint.

## What problem does this solve?
Most qualification stops at "good fit" or "bad fit" - but that leaves sales teams flying blind when it comes to actually engaging the prospect. You know they're qualified, but what are their specific pain points? What value propositions resonate? Which reference customers should you mention? This workflow uses Octave's context engine to not only qualify leads but enrich them with actionable insights that turn cold outreach into warm, contextualized conversations.

## What this workflow does

**Inbound Lead Processing:**
- Receives lead information via webhook (firstName, companyName, companyDomain, profileURL, jobTitle)
- Processes leads from website forms, demo requests, content downloads, or trial signups
- Validates and structures lead data for intelligent qualification and enrichment

**Contextualized Lead Qualification:**
- Leverages Octave's context engine to score leads against your specific ICP
- Analyzes company fit, role relevance, and timing indicators
- Generates qualification scores (1-10) with detailed rationale
- Filters out low-scoring leads (configurable threshold - default &gt;5)

**Deep Lead Enrichment:**
- Uses Octave's enrichment engine to generate contextual insights about qualified leads
- Identifies primary responsibilities, pain points, and relevant value propositions
- Suggests appropriate reference customers and use cases to mention
- Provides sales teams with conversation starters grounded in your business context

**Enhanced Sales Alerts:**
- Sends enriched Slack alerts with qualification score plus actionable insights
- Includes suggested talking points, pain points, and reference customers
- Enables sales teams to have contextualized conversations from first contact

- **Segment Level:** Configure qualification logic for different market segments or use cases
- **Multi-Level Qualification:** Qualify against Product + Persona, Product + Segment, or all three levels combined

**Enrichment Insights:** Configure your Octave enrichment agent to surface the most valuable insights:
- **Primary Responsibilities:** What this person actually does day-to-day
- **Pain Points:** Specific challenges they face that your solution addresses
- **Value Propositions:** Which benefits resonate most with their role and situation
- **Reference Customers:** Similar companies/roles that have succeeded with your solution
- **Conversation Starters:** Contextual talking points for outreach

**Slack Alert Format:** Customize the enrichment data included in alerts:
