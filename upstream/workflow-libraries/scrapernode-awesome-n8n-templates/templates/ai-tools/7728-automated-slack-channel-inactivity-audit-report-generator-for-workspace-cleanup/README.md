![](https://wisestackai.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/slack-channel-inactivity-report-workflow.jpg)
&gt; Automatically scans all public Slack channels weekly to detect those with no activity in the past 30 days, then generates and sends a detailed inactivity report to admins for review and action. Helps keep your Slack workspace clean, relevant, and clutter-free.

## 🧑‍💼 Who’s it for

This workflow is built for:
- **Slack Workspace Admins**
- **IT or Ops Managers**
- **HR/Compliance Teams**
…who want to maintain a clean and active Slack workspace by regularly reviewing **inactive channels**.

## ⚙️ How it works / What it does

This automated n8n workflow:
1. **Runs weekly** via a scheduled trigger.
2. **Fetches all public Slack channels** in the workspace.
3. **Checks message history** of each channel for activity.
4. **Filters channels** that have had **no discussion in the past 30 days**.
5. **Generates a Slack-friendly report** with key metadata (name, member count, purpose, etc.).
6. **Sends the report to a Slack channel** for admin review and possible action (e.g., archive, engage, repurpose).

## 🛠️ How to set up

1. **Configure your Slack App**
   - Go to https://api.slack.com/apps → Create App
   - Add the following **OAuth scopes** to your **Bot Token**:
     - `channels:read` → to get list of public channels
     - `channels:history` → to fetch message history
     - `users:read` → to personalize report (optional)
     - `chat:write` → to post the report to a Slack channel

2. **Install the app in your workspace**  
   - Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token**  
   - Add it to your n8n Slack credentials under "Slack API"

3. **Customize the schedule** in the "Weekly Schedule Trigger" node to control report frequency.

4. **Connect your Slack workspace** to the workflow using your credentials.
