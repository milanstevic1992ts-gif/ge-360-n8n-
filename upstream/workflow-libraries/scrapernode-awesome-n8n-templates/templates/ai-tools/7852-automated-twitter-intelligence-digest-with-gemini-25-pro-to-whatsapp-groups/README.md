## FIND YOUR WHATSAPP GROUPS

The workflow includes a helper node to easily find your WhatsApp group IDs:

1. **Use the Fetch Groups node**: The workflow includes a dedicated node that fetches all your available WhatsApp groups
2. **Run the helper**: Execute just that node to see a list of all groups with their IDs
3. **Copy the group ID**: Find your target group in the list and copy its ID
4. **Update the delivery node**: Paste the group ID into the final WhatsApp sending node

**Group ID format**: Always ends with `@g.us` (example: `120363419788967600@g.us`)

**Pro tip**: Test with a small private group first before deploying to your main team channels.
