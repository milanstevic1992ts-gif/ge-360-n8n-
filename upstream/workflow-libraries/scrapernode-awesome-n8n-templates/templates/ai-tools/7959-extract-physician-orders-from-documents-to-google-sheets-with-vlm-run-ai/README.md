## Description

**Process Physician Orders into Google Sheets with VLM Run AI Extraction**

**What this workflow does**

1. **Monitors Google Drive** for new physician order files in a target folder
2. **Downloads the file** automatically inside n8n for processing
3. **Sends the file to VLM Run** for AI transcription and structured data extraction
4. **Parses healthcare-specific details** from the `healthcare.physician-order` domain as JSON
5. **Appends normalized attributes** to a Google Sheet as a new row

## Setup

**Prerequisites:** Google account, VLM Run API credentials, Google Sheets access, n8n.
Install the verified **VLM Run** node from the n8n node list, then click **Install**. Once installed, you can integrate it directly in your workflow.

**Quick Setup:**

1. Create the Drive folder you want to watch and copy its **Folder ID**
2. Create a Google Sheet with headers such as:
   `timestamp, file_name, file_id, mime_type, size_bytes, uploader_email, patient_name, patient_dob, patient_gender, patient_address, patient_phone_no, physician_name, physician_phone_no, physician_email, referring_clinic, diagnosis, exam_date, form_signed_in`, …other physician order fields as needed
3. Configure **Google Drive OAuth2** for the trigger and download nodes
4. Add your **VLM Run API credentials** from [VLM Run Dashboard](https://app.vlm.run/dashboard) to the VLM Run node
5. Configure **Google Sheets OAuth2** and set Spreadsheet ID + target tab
6. Upload a sample physician order file to the Drive folder to test, then activate
