## Description

## Telegram Pet Grooming Bot – Social Media & Booking Automation

This workflow automates **Facebook posting** and **appointment booking** directly from a **Telegram bot**, making it especially useful for pet grooming businesses that want to keep their social media active while also confirming new bookings in real time.

If you are managing posts manually and handling bookings through chat, this workflow replaces that with an integrated system that connects **Telegram, Google Sheets, Facebook, Google Calendar, and AI models**.

**Use case:** Perfect for grooming shops that want to streamline customer communication, reduce missed appointments, and keep a steady flow of engaging Facebook content.

## How It Works

1. **Trigger Input**

   * The workflow starts when a Telegram user sends either:

     * `/post` → to publish the next pending social media post.
     * `/book` → to schedule a grooming appointment.
     * Or when the workflow runs on a schedule for auto-posting.

2. **Social Media Posting**

   * The workflow retrieves the first entry from a **Google Sheet** where `Uploaded = Fa`.
   * An **AI model** analyzes the pet image and generates a warm, engaging caption.
   * The post (image + caption) is published to your **Facebook Page**.
   * The Google Sheet is updated to mark the post as “Uploaded,” keeping the content queue organized.

3. **Appointment Booking**

   * When a user sends `/book`, the bot collects booking details (pet name, date, and time).
   * The AI model interprets natural inputs like “next Friday at 2 pm” into a proper date-time format.
   * Availability is checked in **Google Calendar**.

     * If free → a new event is created, and the bot sends a confirmation.
     * If unavailable → the user receives a rejection message with alternative suggestions.

4. **Post Queueing**

   * When a user sends an **image with a caption**, the workflow saves it to the **Post Queue Google Sheet**.
   * This keeps posts lined up for later scheduling.

## Google Sheet Queue Structure

Example queue columns:

* **Image\_URL**
* **Pet\_Name**
* **Owner\_Name**
