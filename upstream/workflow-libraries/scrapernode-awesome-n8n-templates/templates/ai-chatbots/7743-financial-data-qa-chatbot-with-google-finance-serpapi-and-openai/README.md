### 2️⃣ Set Up OpenAI Connection  
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

3. Copy your **API Key** into the **OpenAI credentials** in n8n

## 🧠 Workflow Breakdown
1. **Chat Trigger** → User enters a financial question (e.g., “What’s the current price of Tesla?”).  
2. **HTTP Request (SerpApi Finance Search)** → Fetches the latest market data for the requested ticker or index.  
3. **OpenAI Node** → Takes both the raw financial data and the user’s query, then formulates a natural language response.  
4. **Output** → Returns a clear, conversational answer that can be displayed in chat, Slack, or another integration.

## 🎛️ Customization Guidance
- **Multiple Tickers**: Update the workflow to query multiple tickers (e.g., TSLA, AAPL, AMZN) and return a combined report.  
- **Scheduling**: Add a **Schedule Trigger** to run this workflow every morning and send a market recap.  
- **Delivery Channels**: Use Slack, Email, or Google Sheets nodes to distribute reports automatically.  
- **Extended Data**: Adjust the SerpApi query to include more than prices — e.g., company info, market news, or related tickers.  
- **Custom Prompts**: Change the OpenAI system prompt to make the chatbot more formal (for reporting) or casual (for quick insights).
