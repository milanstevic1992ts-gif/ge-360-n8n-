## Description

# This can be your Alternative to Cal AI App

## Overview:
A comprehensive n8n workflow demonstrating advanced AI agent orchestration, stateful conversation management, and multi-modal input processing for nutrition tracking applications.

#### Technical Architecture:
This workflow showcases production-ready patterns for building complex conversational AI systems in n8n:

1. Multi-Agent System Design

Router Agent: Analyzes user intent and routes to specialized sub-agents
Registration Agent: Handles new user onboarding with guided data collection
Meal Logging Agent: Processes text, image, and voice inputs for nutrition analysis
Update Agent: Manages multi-turn conversations for meal corrections
Report Agent: Generates daily nutrition summaries
Profile Agent: Handles user preference updates

2. Stateful Conversation Management
The workflow implements a state machine using n8n Data Tables:

Tracks conversation context across messages
Enables multi-step workflows (e.g., "get meal ID → ask for new description → update")
Prevents context loss in long conversations
Auto-resets state after task completion

3. Multi-Modal Input Processing

Text: Direct AI analysis using Google Gemini
Images: Gemini Vision API with specialized nutrition analysis prompts
Voice: Audio-to-text transcription followed by analysis
Unified output format regardless of input type

4. Advanced Prompt Engineering

Specialized system prompts for each agent role
Structured output formatting for reliable data extraction
Regional cuisine knowledge (African/West African foods)
Error handling and clarification requests built into prompts

5. Data Persistence Layer
Uses n8n Data Tables for:

User profiles (calories, protein targets, preferences)
Meal logs (descriptions, macros, timestamps)
Conversation state (current step, context variables)

6. Telegram Integration

MarkdownV2 formatting with auto-chunking for long messages
Handles all Telegram message types (text, photo, voice)
"Typing" indicators for better UX

#### Learning Outcomes:
By studying this workflow, you'll understand:

How to build agent hierarchies with specialized roles
State management patterns for complex conversations
Multi-modal AI input processing techniques
Production data persistence strategies in n8n
Scalable webhook-based bot architecture

#### Technical Requirements:

n8n version 1.0+ (uses Data Tables feature)
Google Gemini API access
Telegram Bot Token
Basic understanding of: AI agents, webhook triggers, data tables

#### Difficulty Level: Intermediate to Advanced
Use Cases Beyond Nutrition:
The patterns here apply to any domain requiring:

Multi-step user onboarding
Data collection through conversation
Record updates via natural language
Report generation
Profile management

#### Components:

50+ nodes demonstrating n8n AI features
6 specialized AI agents
3 data tables with structured schemas
Custom JavaScript for MIME type handling and markdown formatting
Integration with Google Gemini (text + vision + audio models)

#### What Makes This Workflow Unique:
Most n8n AI examples show simple Q&A bots. This demonstrates enterprise-grade conversation management with real data persistence, making it suitable for actual production deployment.

Creating accounts on platforms (n8n, Google Cloud, Telegram)
Following step-by-step instructions
Copy-pasting API keys
Basic JSON importing

No programming experience required. If you can use Zapier or Make.com, you can set this up.

Prerequisites (30 minutes to gather)
1. n8n Account

Option A (Easiest): Sign up for n8n Cloud at n8n.io (14-day free trial, then $20/month)
Option B (Free): Self-host n8n on DigitalOcean/Railway/your server

2. Google Gemini API Key

Go to ai.google.dev
Click "Get API Key"
Create new project (free tier: 15 requests/minute)
Copy your API key

3. Telegram Bot

Open Telegram and search for @BotFather
Send /newbot command
Follow prompts to create your bot
Copy the bot token (looks like: 1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz)


Step 1: Import the Workflow (5 minutes)

Log into your n8n instance
Click "New Workflow" in top left
Click the three-dot menu → Import from File
Upload the My_workflow.json file you downloaded
The workflow will appear with all nodes connected


Step 2: Create Data Tables (10 minutes)
The workflow uses three data tables to store information. Create them exactly as shown:
Table 1: Cal AI Profiles

Navigate to n8n Data Tables section
Click Create Data Table
Name: Cal AI Profiles
Add columns:

User_ID (Text)
Name (Text)
Email (Text)
Calories_target (Number)
Protein_target (Number)
Country (Text)

Table 2: Cal AI Meals

Create new table: Cal AI Meals
Add columns:

Meal_ID (Text)
User_ID (Text)
Date (Text)
Meal_description (Text)
Calories (Number)
Proteins (Number)
Carbs (Text)
Fats (Text)


Table 3: Cal AI StateManagement

Create new table: Cal AI StateManagement
Add columns:

User_ID (Text)
State (Text)
Last_Interaction (DateTime)
Context_MealID (Text)


Step 3: Configure Credentials (15 minutes)
A. Add Google Gemini Credential

In any Google Gemini node, click "Create New Credential"
Paste your Gemini API key
Click Save
This credential will auto-apply to all Gemini nodes

B. Add Telegram Credential

Open any Telegram node
Click "Create New Credential"
Paste your bot token
Click Save

C. Link Data Tables

Open the "Is User Registered?" node
Click the Data Table dropdown
Select "Cal AI Profiles"
Repeat for all nodes with data table connections (n8n will show which ones need updating)


Step 4: Activate Telegram Webhook (5 minutes)

Open the "Telegram Trigger" node
