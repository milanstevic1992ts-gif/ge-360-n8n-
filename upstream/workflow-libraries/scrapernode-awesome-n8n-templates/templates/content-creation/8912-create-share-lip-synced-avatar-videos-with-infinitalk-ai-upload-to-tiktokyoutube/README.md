# 🎬 Create & share lip-synced avatar videos with Infinitalk AI & upload to TikTok/YouTube

> ⚡ **910 views** · 🎬 [Content Creation & Video](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

## Description

This workflow automates the process of generating and publishing a **talking avatar video**.
It takes a **video** and an **audio file** as inputs, then uses the Infinitalk API to create a lip-synced avatar that naturally matches the audio. Once generated, the video is:

1. Retrieved and stored (Google Drive upload).
2. Optimized with an **AI-generated YouTube title** for better SEO.
3. Automatically uploaded to **YouTube** and **TikTok** via the Upload-Post API.

### How It Works

The process begins with a form submission where users provide a video URL (for the avatar), an audio URL (for lip-sync), and a text prompt describing the video content. The system then:

1. **Video Generation**: Sends the inputs to Fal.ai's Infinitalk API which creates a talking avatar video where the character lip-syncs to the provided audio with natural facial expressions
2. **Status Monitoring**: Continuously checks the processing status every 60 seconds until the video generation is completed
3. **Title Generation**: Uses OpenAI's GPT model to create an SEO-optimized YouTube title based on the original prompt
4. **File Handling**: Downloads the generated video and uploads it to Google Drive for storage
5. **Multi-Platform Distribution**: Automatically publishes the video to both YouTube and TikTok using the Upload-Post service

The workflow includes conditional logic to ensure each step executes in the correct order and only proceeds when previous operations are successful.
