### **Create Stunning CGI Videos with Sora 2 API and Google Drive Integration**
The [**Sora 2 API**](https://rapidapi.com/skdeveloper/api/sora-2-openai) allows seamless generation of CGI ads, turning text prompts into stunning videos. This workflow automates the entire process from video generation to upload, notification, and file sharing via Google Drive.

### **Node-by-Node Explanation**

1. **On form submission**: Triggers the workflow when a form with a prompt is submitted.
2. **Sora API Processor:** The prompt is sent to the Sora 2 API's txttovideo.php endpoint to initiate video generation.
(This step calls the API where the magic of turning text into video happens.)
2. **Wait for API Response**: Pauses for 60 seconds before checking the API response.
3. **API Request: Check Task Status**: Sends an HTTP request to check the status of the CGI ad generation task.
4. **Condition: Task Output Status**: Validates the task status (success, processing, failed).
5. **Wait for Task to Complete**: Waits for another 60 seconds to recheck the task completion status.
6. **Send Email: API Error - Task ID Missing**: Sends an email if the prediction ID is missing in the response.
7. **Upload File to Google Drive**: Uploads the CGI ad video to Google Drive.
8. **Set Google Drive Permissions**: Configures file permissions for sharing.
9. **Send an email: Video Link**: Notifies the user with a link to the uploaded video.
10. **Sticky Notes**: Annotates and documents each step in the process for clarity.
