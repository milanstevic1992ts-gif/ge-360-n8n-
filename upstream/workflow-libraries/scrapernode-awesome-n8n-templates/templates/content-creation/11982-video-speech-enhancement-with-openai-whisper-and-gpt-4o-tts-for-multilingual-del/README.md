# 🎙️ AI Video Speech Correction & Multilingual Voiceover Generator

### Create Professional Explanation Videos — Without Re-Recording Your Voice  
This workflow was built to solve a **real, painful creator problem**:  
you know *what* to explain, but you don’t like how you sound, hesitate while speaking, or don’t feel fluent enough on camera.

With this automation, you can **record freely and imperfectly**, and the system will:
- transcribe what you said,
- **clean and rewrite your speech** into a clear, structured explanation,
- generate a **natural AI voiceover**,  
- perfectly **retime the video** so visuals still match the narration,
- and even **output the video in multiple languages**.

You focus on explaining.  
The AI handles clarity, fluency, tone, and delivery.

### Who This Is Built For  
✅ **Educators & trainers** creating walkthroughs or LMS videos  
✅ **Consultants & SaaS founders** recording product explanations  
✅ **Content creators** who dislike their recorded voice  
✅ **Non-native speakers** who want fluent, professional narration  
✅ **Agencies** producing multilingual explainer content at scale  

If you’ve ever thought *“I know this, I just don’t say it well”* — this is for you.

### What This Workflow Does (Technically & Practically)

1. **Upload an MP4 video** via a simple form (Telegram / webhook-based).
2. The system:
   - Extracts the original audio
   - Transcribes speech with AI
3. Each spoken segment is:
   - Matched with an on-screen video frame.
   - **Rewritten by AI** to remove fillers, hesitations, slang, or unclear phrasing.
   - Adjusted to match on-screen context and timing.
4. The cleaned script is:
   - Converted into **high-quality AI voiceover** with precise synchronization.
5. The video is then:
   - **Retimed scene-by-scene** so visuals align with the new narration.
   - Reassembled into a clean, professional final video.
6. The output can be:
   - Generated in **multiple languages** (e.g. EN / AR).
   - Delivered via **Telegram** and/or uploaded to **Google Drive**.

Result:  
🎥 A polished explanation video — without re-recording a single sentence.

### Why This Workflow Is Extremely Valuable

- **No need to re-record** takes because of mistakes or accent issues  
- **Perfect for tutorials & demos** where clarity matters more than personality  
- **Multilingual by design** — same video, different languages  
- **Consistent tone & pacing** across all videos  
- **Zero manual editing** once deployed  

This replaces:
- multiple retakes,
- manual script rewriting,
- external voiceover tools,
- and timeline guessing in video editors.

### Why Buy This Instead of Building It Yourself

- **Save 40–60 hours** of R&D 
- Avoid extremely tricky **audio/video retiming problems**  
- Get a **production-grade workflow**, not a demo script  

This is the kind of system most people *try* to build and abandon halfway.

---

### Technical Requirements
- n8n (self-hosted strongly recommended)
- Server with:
  - **FFmpeg & FFprobe**
  - SSH + SFTP access
- **OpenAI API key** (Whisper + TTS)
- Optional:
  - Google Drive (for archiving)
  - Telegram bot (for delivery)

⚠️ Video retiming and audio synthesis are CPU/RAM intensive.  
Use a server sized for video workloads.

---

### Customization Options
- Supported languages (e.g. EN, AR — easily extendable)
- AI rewriting style (formal, friendly, instructional)
- Voice personality and tone
- TTS voice selection per language
- Output destinations (Telegram, Drive, S3, etc.)

---

### Bottom Line 💡  
This workflow lets you **think out loud**, make mistakes, and still end up with a **studio-quality explanation video**.

No mic anxiety.  
No re-recording.  
No language barrier.

Just explain → AI perfects → video is ready.
