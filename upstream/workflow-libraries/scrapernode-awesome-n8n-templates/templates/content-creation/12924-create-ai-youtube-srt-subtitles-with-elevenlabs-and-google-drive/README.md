This workflow automates the creation of SRT subtitle files from YouTube videos using AI speech recognition. 

The process begins when the workflow is manually triggered, requiring a YouTube video URL as input. The system first fetches the video content via HTTP request, then sends the audio to ElevenLabs for transcription. 

The AI returns timestamped text segments which are intelligently split into readable subtitle chunks based on punctuation and length constraints. 

These segments are formatted into standard SRT (SubRip) format with precise timing, converted to a binary file, and finally uploaded to a specified Google Drive folder as a ready-to-use subtitle file.

### Set up Steps

1. **Configure Video Source**: In the "Set Video Url" node, replace the placeholder value with a valid YouTube video URL or set up a method to dynamically provide URLs
2. **API Credentials Setup**:
   - Configure [ElevenLabs API](https://try.elevenlabs.io/ahkbf00hocnu) credentials in the "Transcribe audio or video" node with your API key
   - Set up Google Drive OAuth2 credentials in the "Upload file" node with appropriate folder permissions
3. **Customize Output**: Adjust the SRT generation parameters in the "From Elevenlabs to Srt" node if different subtitle formatting is needed
4. **Destination Folder**: Verify the Google Drive folder ID in the upload node points to your desired destination
5. **Execution**: Trigger the workflow manually and provide a video URL when prompted to generate and upload subtitles
