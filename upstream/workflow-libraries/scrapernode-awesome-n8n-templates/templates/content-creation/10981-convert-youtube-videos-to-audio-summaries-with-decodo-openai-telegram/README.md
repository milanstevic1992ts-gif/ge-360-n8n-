## Description

**Stop watching long videos, start listening to concise summaries.**

This workflow transforms any YouTube video URL sent via Telegram into a high-quality, spoken audio summary (MP3) and a structured text overview. It acts as your personal AI research assistant, turning lengthy content into bite-sized audio files that you can consume on the go.

It leverages **Decodo** for robust transcript extraction, **OpenAI** for intelligent summarization, and for realistic text-to-speech generation.

### **✨ Features**
* **Telegram-First Interface:** Send links and receive audio directly in your chat app.
* **Smart Validation:** Automatically checks if the link is a valid YouTube URL before processing to save API credits.
* **Multi-Language Support:** Easily configure the output language (English, Spanish, German, etc.) via a simple Config node. The AI will translate and speak in this language.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Gracefully handles videos with no captions/transcripts by notifying the user instead of breaking the workflow.
* **Structured Data Extraction:** Uses AI to extract the Genre, Title, and Summary alongside the audio file.

### **⚙️ How it Works**
1.  **Trigger:** You send a YouTube URL to your Telegram Bot.
2.  **Validate:** The workflow checks the URL pattern using Regex.
3.  **Extract:** **Decodo** scrapes the video page to retrieve the full transcript JSON.
4.  **Process:** A Code node flattens the complex JSON into a readable text format.
5.  **Summarize:** **OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini)** analyzes the text and writes a script optimized for listening.
6.  **Speak:** **OpenAI** converts the script into a high-definition MP3 file.
7.  **Deliver:** The bot replies with the Audio File and a formatted text summary including the genre tags and original link.

### **➕ How to Adapt the Template**

This workflow is highly flexible and can be modified for various content tasks:

* **Change AI Model:** Easily swap the **OpenAI Chat Model** node with an **OpenAI** or **Anthropic (Claude)** node without altering the core logic.
* **Create Long-Form Drafts:** Modify the AI System Prompt to generate a full 1,000-word blog post draft or a set of social media updates instead of a short audio script.
* **Change Destination:** Replace the **Telegram** nodes with **Slack**, **Microsoft Teams**, **Email (Gmail/SMTP)**, or **Discord** to deliver the audio and summary to your preferred channel.
* **Create an Archive:** Connect the successful output to a **Google Sheets** or **Airtable** node to keep a searchable archive of every video summary created.
