## Description

✨ About this Template

This n8n template automates the process of writing SEO guest post content using OpenAI, based on rules and topics provided in a Google Sheet. The generated articles are saved into a separate sheet for outreach or publishing.

Use cases include:

SEO guest post generation

Content marketing automation for agencies

Outreach planning and editorial automation

💡 Good to Know

OpenAI API usage costs apply based on the selected model (e.g., GPT-4).

This automation uses Google Sheets and OpenAI; credentials are required to connect your accounts.

Status filtering ensures only content marked as “Start” is processed — making it safe to use in multi-user workflows.

⚙️ How It Works

Trigger the workflow manually (can be changed to schedule/cron or webhook).

Reads from a Google Sheet with guest post planning data.

Merges the writing prompt, brand guidelines, and posting rules.

Sends the merged data to OpenAI (via the AI Agent node) to generate a guest post in German.

Saves the result into another Google Sheet.

Updates the original row's status from “Start” to “Finished” to prevent duplicates.

▶️ How to Use

You must connect your Google Sheets and OpenAI accounts.

Customize the AI prompt, tone, or language by editing the input structure.

You can modify the filter to run only on certain months or categories.

The Gmail node is optional and only used to notify when no action was taken.

🧰 Requirements

OpenAI account (API key for GPT-4 or GPT-3.5)

Google account with access to the configured Sheets

Basic knowledge of how n8n expressions work (optional)

🛠️ Customising This Workflow
