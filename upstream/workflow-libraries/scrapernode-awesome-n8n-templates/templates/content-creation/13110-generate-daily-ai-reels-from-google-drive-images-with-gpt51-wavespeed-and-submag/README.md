> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

## Description

# Image to Video Social Media Reel Generator + Autopost Without AI Slop

Google Drive → AI Video Generation → Captions → Approval → Instagram & TikTok

Watch Step-By-Step Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPOYxQF25ws

Turn a folder of images into fully-produced short-form social media reels—automatically.
This workflow picks a random image, generates a cinematic AI video from it, adds text overlays and captions, waits for your approval, and then posts to Instagram and TikTok.

## What this template does

On a scheduled basis (default: daily at 9:00 AM), this workflow:
Selects a random image from a Google Drive folder
Uploads the image for processing
Generates a cinematic image-to-video prompt using AI
Creates an 8-second vertical video using an image-to-video model (via Wavespeed)
Applies captions and text overlays using Submagic
Waits for human approval via email
Automatically posts the approved reel to:
Instagram
TikTok
If the video is not approved, the workflow loops and tries again on the next run.

## Why this workflow is useful
Converts static images into high-engagement video content
Removes repetitive manual work in short-form content creation
Keeps a human-in-the-loop before anything is published

Perfect for:
Creators & solopreneurs
Social media managers
Small businesses & local brands
AI-first content pipelines
High-level flow
Schedule → Pick Image → Generate Video → Add Captions → Approve → Post

## Customization ideas

Change video duration, aspect ratio, or style
Modify the AI prompt to match your brand voice
Post only after manual approval (already built-in)
Add a Slack or Telegram approval step
Duplicate posting logic for YouTube Shorts or Facebook Reels
Store generated videos in cloud storage or a content database

## Troubleshooting

No images found: check Drive folder ID and permissions
Video stuck generating: increase wait time or polling interval
Approval email not received: verify Gmail OAuth and inbox filters
