> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

## Description

## 🎨 TikTok Carousel Replicator & Translator
An end-to-end automation system that monitors TikTok accounts for new 3-image carousel posts, extracts text overlays and visual layouts using AI vision analysis, translates content into English, and automatically regenerates brand-new carousel images ready for review and posting.

### What It Does
This workflow eliminates the manual process of:
- Daily monitoring for new carousel content
- Screenshot capture and image extraction
- Text transcription and translation
- Layout recreation in design tools
- Manual formatting and brand consistency checks

Instead, it delivers **3 production-ready images to your inbox every morning**—complete with translated text, matched composition, and side-by-side comparisons for quick approval.

### Key Features
- **Automated Daily Monitoring** - Checks target TikTok accounts on schedule
- **AI-Powered Vision Analysis** - Extracts text, layout, and composition with Gemini Vision
- **Smart Translation** - Converts text to natural English while preserving intent
- **Intelligent Image Generation** - Recreates carousels with Midjourney/DALL-E based on analyzed layouts
- **Review Dashboard** - Organized Google Sheets with original vs. new comparisons
- **Email Notifications** - Morning digest with clickable previews

### Who It's For
Content creators, social media managers, and marketing teams who need to adapt high-performing carousel content from other languages into English—without spending hours in Canva every day.

### Time Saved
**From 3+ hours of manual work → 2 minutes of review** per carousel set.

### Workflow Breakdown
**Monitor** → **Extract & Analyze** → **Translate** → **Generate** → **Review & Deliver**

Each section runs automatically, processing images sequentially and delivering organized results to your review dashboard with email notifications.
