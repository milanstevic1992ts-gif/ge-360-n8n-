### **How It Works**  
This workflow automates the creation of WooCommerce products and generates optimized SEO meta tags (title and description) using AI. Here’s the step-by-step process:  

- **Data Retrieval**: The workflow starts by fetching product details (title, category, description, price, etc.) from a Google Sheets document.  
- **Product Creation**: Each product is created in WooCommerce using the retrieved data, including categories, pricing, stock details, and images.  
- **AI-Powered SEO Optimization**: An AI model (Google Gemini via OpenRouter) analyzes the product details and generates SEO-optimized meta titles (≤60 chars) and meta descriptions (≤160 chars).  
- **Meta Tag Assignment**: The generated meta tags are saved back to the Google Sheets and applied to the WooCommerce product using Yoast SEO metadata.  
- **Completion Tracking**: The workflow marks completed entries in Google Sheets and sends a Telegram notification upon finishing all products.

### **Set Up Steps**  
Before running the workflow, ensure the following steps are completed:  

- **Step 1**: Install the Yoast SEO plugin on WordPress and add the provided PHP code to `functions.php` to enable meta tag API support.  
- **Step 2**: Enable the WooCommerce REST API in WordPress and configure the Telegram node with a valid `CHAT_ID` for notifications.  
- **Step 3**: Prepare a Google Sheet with product data (columns A-I in specific formats) and share its ID in the workflow. Ensure columns B, E, and F are in text format, and column I is numeric.  

Once set up, the workflow can be triggered manually or scheduled to run automatically, streamlining product creation and SEO optimization.
