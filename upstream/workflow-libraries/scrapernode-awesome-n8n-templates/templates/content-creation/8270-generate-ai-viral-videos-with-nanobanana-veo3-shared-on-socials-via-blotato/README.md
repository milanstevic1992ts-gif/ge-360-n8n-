> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

# Generate AI viral videos with NanoBanana & VEO3, shared on socials via Blotato  

## Who is this for?  
This workflow is designed for **content creators, marketers, and entrepreneurs** who want to automate their video production and social media publishing process. If you regularly post promotional or viral-style content on platforms like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, LinkedIn, and more, this template will save you hours of manual work.  

---

## What problem is this workflow solving? / Use case  
Creating **viral short-form videos** is often time-consuming:  
- You need to generate visuals, write scripts, edit videos, and then manually upload them to multiple platforms.  
- Staying consistent across **TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and others** requires constant effort.  

This workflow solves the problem by **automating the entire pipeline** from idea → video creation → multi-platform publishing.  

---

## What this workflow does  
1. **Collects an idea and image** from Telegram.  
2. **Enhances visuals with NanoBanana** for user-generated content style.  
3. **Generates a complete video script with AI** (OpenAI + structured prompts).  
4. **Creates the final video with VEO3** using your custom prompt and visuals.  
5. **Rewrites captions with GPT** to be short, catchy, and optimized for social platforms.  
6. **Saves metadata in Google Sheets** for tracking and management.  
7. **Auto-uploads the video to all major platforms via Blotato** (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, Threads, Pinterest, X/Twitter, Bluesky, Facebook).  
8. **Notifies you on Telegram** with a preview link once publishing is complete.  

---

## Setup  
1. **Connect your accounts**:  
   - Google Sheets (for video tracking)  
   - Telegram (to receive and send media)  
   - Blotato (for multi-platform publishing)  
   - OpenAI API (for captions, prompts, and image analysis)  
   - VEO3 API (for video rendering)  
   - Fal.ai (for NanoBanana image editing)  
   - Google Drive (to store processed images)  

2. **Set your credentials** in the respective nodes.  
3. **Adjust the Google Sheet IDs** to match your own sheet structure.  
4. **Insert your Telegram bot token** in the `Set: Bot Token (Placeholder)` node.

## How to customize this workflow to your needs  
- **Platforms**: Disable or enable only the Blotato social accounts you want to post to.  
- **Video style**: Adjust the master prompt schema in the `Set Master Prompt` node to fine-tune tone, camera style, or video format.  
- **Captions**: Modify the GPT prompt in the `Rewrite Caption with GPT-4o` node to control length and tone.  
- **Notifications**: Customize the Telegram nodes to notify team members, not just yourself.  
- **Scheduling**: Add a Cron trigger if you want automatic posting at specific times.

✨ With this workflow, you go from **idea → AI-enhanced video → instant multi-platform publishing** in just minutes, with almost no manual work.
