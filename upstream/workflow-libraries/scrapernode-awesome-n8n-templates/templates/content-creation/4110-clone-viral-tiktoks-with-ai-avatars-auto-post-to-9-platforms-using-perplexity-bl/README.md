> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

# Clone a viral TikTok with AI and auto-post it to 9 platforms using Perplexity & Blotato

### Who is this for?

This workflow is perfect for:
- Content creators looking to repurpose viral content
- Social media managers who want to scale short-form content across multiple platforms
- Entrepreneurs and marketers aiming to save time and boost visibility with AI-powered automation

### What problem is this workflow solving?

Reproducing viral video formats with your own branding and pushing them to multiple platforms is time-consuming and hard to scale. This workflow solves that by:
- Cloning a viral TikTok video’s structure
- Generating a new version with your avatar
- Rewriting the script, caption, and overlay text
- Auto-posting it to 9 social media platforms — without manual uploads

### What this workflow does

From a simple Telegram message with a TikTok link, the workflow:

1. **Downloads a TikTok video** and extracts its thumbnail, audio, and caption
2. **Transcribes the audio** and saves original text into Google Sheets
3. **Uses Perplexity AI** to suggest a new content idea in the same niche
4. **Rewrites the script, caption, and overlay** using GPT-4o
5. **Generates a new video** with your avatar using Captions.ai
6. **Adds subtitles and overlay text** with JSON2Video
7. **Saves metadata** to Google Sheets for tracking
8. **Sends the final video to Telegram** for preview
9. **Auto-publishes the video** to Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, Threads, X (Twitter), Pinterest, and Bluesky via Blotato

### Setup

1. Connect your **Telegram bot** to the trigger node.
2. Add your **OpenAI, Perplexity, Cloudinary, Captions.ai, and Blotato API keys**.
3. Make sure your **Google Sheet** is ready with the appropriate columns.
4. Replace the default **avatar name** in the Captions.ai node with yours.
5. Fill in your **social media account IDs** in the "Assign Platform IDs" node.
6. Test by sending a TikTok URL to your Telegram bot.

### How to customize this workflow to your needs

- **Change avatar output style**: adjust resolution, voice, or avatar ID.
- **Refine script structure**: tweak GPT instructions for different tone/format.
- **Swap Perplexity with ChatGPT or Claude** if needed.
- **Filter by platform**: disable any Blotato nodes you don’t need.
- **Add approval step**: insert a Telegram confirmation node before publishing.
- **Adjust subtitle style or overlay text font** in JSON2Video.
