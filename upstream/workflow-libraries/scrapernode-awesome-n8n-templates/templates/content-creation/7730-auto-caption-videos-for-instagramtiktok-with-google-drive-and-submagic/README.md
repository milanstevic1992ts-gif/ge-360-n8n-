> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Heads up — if this workflow's Instagram scraping breaks (it happens whenever Meta updates their frontend), [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/instagram) is a community node that handles [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/profiles), [posts](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/posts), [reels](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/reels), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/instagram/scrapers/comments) without any HTML parsing.

## Description

🎥 Auto-Caption Videos for Instagram with Google Drive + Submagic

Description
Save hours on video editing with this workflow! Whenever you upload a video to a specific Google Drive folder, it’s automatically sent to Submagic to generate engaging captions (using your chosen template). Once the captioned video is ready, it’s pulled back, downloaded, and uploaded into your Google Drive—fully captioned and Instagram-ready.

How It Works

Wait Loop + Status Check – Polls Submagic until the captioning job is complete.

Download Captioned Video – Retrieves the finished captioned video file.

Upload to Google Drive – Saves the captioned version back into Drive, ready for Instagram posting.
