## Description

## Who’s it For
This template is perfect for daily fantasy sports (DFS) enthusiasts, sports analysts, and content creators who want automated, AI-optimized lineups for DraftKings contests. Works for multiple sports including NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and esports like LOL and CS.

## How It Works / What It Does
The workflow uses the DraftKings API Actor to scrape real-time contest and player data. It calculates player value based on projected points and salary, and then uses AI to generate optimized DFS lineups. Generated lineups are logged to Google Sheets, emailed to subscribers with AI-personalized messaging, and internal teams are notified via Slack. Filters allow skipping contests that are too expensive, almost full, or starting too soon.

## How to Set Up
1. Configure DraftKings API Actor: select sport, maxContests, includePlayerData.
2. Google Sheets: enter Sheet ID and worksheet for logging lineups.
3. Email Node: configure SMTP or SendGrid for sending subscriber emails.
4. Slack Node: enter channel for team notifications.
5. Adjust workflow schedule for daily or pre-game runs.
6. Optional: modify contest filters (entry fee, prize pool, start time).

- n8n instance with nodes: DraftKings API Actor, Set, Function, IF, OpenAI, SplitInBatches, Google Sheets, Email, Slack
