> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

### Automatically generate Linkedin Carousal and Upload to Linkedin

Use case : Linkedin Content Creation, specifically carousal. But could be adjusted for many other creations as well.

### How it works
* It will run automatically every 6:00 AM
* Get latest News from TechRadar
* Parse it into readable JSON
* AI will decide, which news resonates with your profile
* Then give the title and description of that news to generate the final linkedin carousal content.
* This step is also trigerred by Form trigger
* After carousal generation, it will give it to Post Nitro to create images on that content. 
* Post Nitro provides the PDF file.
* We Upload the PDf file to Linkedin and get the file ID, in next step, it will be used.
* Finally create the Post description and Post it to Linkedin

### How to use
* It will run every 6:00 AM automatically. Just make it Live
* Submit the form, with correct title and description ( i did not added tests for that so must give that correct 😅 )
