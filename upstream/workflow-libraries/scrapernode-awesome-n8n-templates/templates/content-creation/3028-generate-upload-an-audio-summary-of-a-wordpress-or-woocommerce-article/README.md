## Description

This workflow automates the process of summarizing or transcribing a WordPress article, **converting the text into speech** using Eleven Labs API, and uploading the resulting MP3 file back to WordPress.

**How It Works**	
1.	Trigger – The workflow starts manually when the user clicks “Test Workflow”.
2.	Retrieve Article – It fetches a WordPress article based on a given post ID.
3.	Summarize or Transcribe – An LLM (GPT-4o-mini) generates either:
	•	A summary of the article, or
	•	A full transcription, depending on the chosen prompt.
4.	Generate Speech – The processed text (summary or transcription) is converted into an MP3 audio file using Eleven Labs API.
5.	Upload MP3 to WordPress – The generated MP3 file is uploaded to WordPress.
6.	Update WordPress Post – The article is updated with an embedded audio player, allowing users to listen to the summary or transcription.

**Set Up Steps**
	1.	WordPress API Credentials
	•	Configure your WordPress API credentials in n8n.
	2.	[Eleven Labs](https://try.elevenlabs.io/text-audio) API Key
	•	Obtain an API Key from Eleven Labs and configure it in n8n.
	3.	Choose Between Summary or Transcription
	•	Modify the AI prompt to either generate a summary or keep the full transcription.
	4.	Test the Workflow
	•	Run the workflow and ensure the MP3 file is correctly generated and uploaded.

**💡 Customization Options**
	•	Modify the AI prompt to switch between a summary and a transcription.
	•	Change the voice model in Eleven Labs for different speech styles.
	•	Adjust output format to higher/lower quality MP3.

🚀 This automation improves content accessibility and engagement by allowing users to listen to a summarized or full version of the article.
