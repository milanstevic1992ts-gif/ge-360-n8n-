# 🎥 End-to-End YouTube Video Automation Workflow with n8n, HeyGen & AI

**Automate the entire YouTube content creation pipeline — from video idea to AI-generated avatar video, upload, metadata generation, and publishing — with zero manual intervention!**

---

### Who is this for?

This template is perfect for:

* **Affiliate marketers** (e.g., PartnerStack, SaaS products)
* **YouTube creators** scaling video production
* **Agencies** managing client content
* **Educators and coaches** delivering automated video lessons
* **Entrepreneurs** running faceless YouTube channels

---

### 🧠 What problem does it solve?

Publishing consistent, high-quality video content is essential for audience growth and monetization. But manually creating each video — researching, writing, recording, uploading, and optimizing — is slow, repetitive, and unsustainable at scale.

This workflow solves that by automating:

* ✅ Content sourcing from Google Sheets
* ✅ Script generation with AI
* ✅ Avatar video creation via HeyGen
* ✅ YouTube upload and metadata
* ✅ Final publishing and status update

All done without touching a single button. Schedule it weekly and watch videos go live while you sleep.
