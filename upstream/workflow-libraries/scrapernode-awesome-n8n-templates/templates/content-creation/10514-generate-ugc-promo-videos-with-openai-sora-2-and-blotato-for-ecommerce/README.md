> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

# 💥 Generate UGC Promo Videos with Blotato and Sora 2 for eCommerce

![Workflow Overview](https://www.dr-firas.com/sora22.png)

### 🧩 Who is this for?
This workflow is perfect for **eCommerce brands, content creators, and marketing teams** who want to automatically generate short, eye-catching videos from their product images — without editing software or manual work.

### 🚀 What problem does this workflow solve?
Creating engaging promotional videos manually can be time-consuming and expensive.  
This automation eliminates that friction by combining **Blotato**, **Sora 2**, and **AI scripting** to turn static product images into dynamic UGC-style videos ready for **TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts**.

### ⚙️ What this workflow does
This workflow:
1. Receives a **product image** directly from Telegram or another input source.  
2. Analyzes the image with **OpenAI Vision** to understand the product’s features and audience.  
3. Generates a natural, short **UGC-style script** using GPT-based AI.  
4. Sends the image and script to **Sora 2 via the Fal API** to generate a **vertical promotional video**.  
5. Monitors the video status every 15 seconds until completion.  
6. Downloads or automatically publishes the final video to your social platforms.

### 🧠 Setup
1. Create a **Fal.ai API key** and set it in your n8n credentials (`Authorization: Key YOUR_FAL_KEY`).  
2. Connect your **Telegram**, **OpenAI**, and **HTTP Request** nodes as shown in the workflow.  
3. Make sure the `Build Public Image URL` node outputs a valid, public image link.  
4. In the HTTP Request node for Sora 2, set:  
   - **Method:** POST  
   - **URL:** `https://fal.run/fal-ai/sora-2/image-to-video`  
   - **Headers:**  
     - `Authorization: Key YOUR_FAL_KEY`  
     - `Content-Type: application/json`  
   - **Body:** Raw JSON with parameters like `prompt`, `image_url`, `duration`, and `aspect_ratio`.  
5. Run the workflow and monitor the execution logs for your video URL.
6. [Blotato](https://blotato.com/?ref=firas) → API key for social media publishing  


### 🎨 How to customize this workflow to your needs
- 🧾 **Change the video tone:** Edit the OpenAI prompt to produce educational, emotional, or luxury-style scripts.  
- 🎬 **Adjust duration or format:** Use Sora 2’s supported durations (4, 8, or 12 seconds) and aspect ratios (e.g., `9:16` for social media).  
- 📲 **Auto-publish your videos:** Connect the TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube upload nodes for full automation.  
- ✨ **Add branding:** Include overlays, logos, or end screens via CapCut or an external API integration.
