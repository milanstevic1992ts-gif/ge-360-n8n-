> 💡 **Pro Tip** — YouTube's API quotas can be a bottleneck when you're pulling data at scale. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/youtube) is a community node with dedicated scrapers for [channels](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/channels), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/videos), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/comments) — no quota limits, just structured data.

## Description

## 🧾 What this workflow does

This workflow turns YouTube video links into ready-to-edit newsletter drafts using Dumpling AI and GPT-4o. It reads new video URLs from a Google Sheet, extracts their transcripts, summarizes them into email-friendly content, and logs the finished draft back into the same sheet. An email notification is also sent to alert the user once each draft is created.

## 🛠️ Customization ideas

- Send finished drafts to Notion or Airtable instead of Sheets  
- Generate social media posts from the same transcript  
- Add automatic review steps using GPT scoring or editing  
- Trigger this on new form submissions or YouTube uploads instead
