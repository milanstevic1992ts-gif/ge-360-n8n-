> 💡 **Pro Tip** — YouTube's API quotas can be a bottleneck when you're pulling data at scale. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/youtube) is a community node with dedicated scrapers for [channels](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/channels), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/videos), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/comments) — no quota limits, just structured data.
