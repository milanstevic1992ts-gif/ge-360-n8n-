> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Twitter's API is paid now, which makes simple data pulls expensive. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/twitter) is a community node that scrapes [Twitter profiles](https://scrapernode.com/twitter/scrapers/profiles) and [posts](https://scrapernode.com/twitter/scrapers/posts) without needing API access.

## Description

## AI-Powered Japanese Social Media Content Generator with Quality Control

### 🎯 Who's it for

Marketing teams and social media managers in Japan who want to automate content creation while maintaining high quality standards and cultural appropriateness. Perfect for businesses that need consistent Japanese-language social media presence with built-in compliance checks.

### 📝 What it does

This workflow creates an intelligent content generation system that:

- Generates culturally-aware Japanese Twitter posts using GPT-4
- Automatically scores content quality across 5 dimensions (engagement, SEO, brand voice, readability, CTA)
- Performs sentiment analysis and risk detection for controversial topics
- Routes content intelligently: auto-posts high-quality/low-risk content, flags medium-risk content for approval, and rejects high-risk content
- Includes an auto-improvement loop that refines content up to 3 times if quality scores are below 70
- Provides weekly performance analytics and recommendations

### 🔧 How it works

**Daily Content Generation Flow:**
1. Schedule trigger runs weekday mornings at 9 AM
2. Fetches Japanese cultural context (seasons, holidays, business events)
3. Analyzes brand voice from past 30 days of posts
4. Generates 3 Twitter post variations with GPT-4
5. Each post is scored on quality metrics (100-point scale)
6. Low-scoring content enters auto-improvement loop
7. Risk analysis checks for controversy, cultural sensitivity, and sentiment
8. Decision routing: auto-approve and post OR send for manual approval OR reject

**Approval Workflow:**
- Pending posts trigger approval emails
- Webhook receives approval/rejection/edit actions
- Approved posts are published to Twitter and archived in Notion

**Weekly Analytics:**
- Monday morning trigger analyzes past week's performance
- GPT-4 generates insights report with best practices
- Email sent to team with recommendations

### ⚙️ Requirements

**APIs & Credentials:**
- OpenAI API (GPT-4 access)
- Twitter API v2 with OAuth 2.0
- Notion API (database for content storage)
- Email sending service (SMTP or SendGrid)

**Setup:**
1. Create a Notion database with columns: Content, Hashtags, Quality Score, Risk Level, Status, Engagement
2. Configure OpenAI API credentials with HTTP Header Auth
3. Set up Twitter OAuth 2.0 credentials
4. Configure email service for approval notifications

### 🎨 How to customize

**Adjust Quality Thresholds:**

**Content Generation:**
- Edit GPT-4 prompts in "Generate Content with GPT-4" node to match your brand tone
- Adjust temperature settings for more/less creative content

**Risk Detection:**

- Add industry-specific compliance checks

**Brand Voice Learning:**

- Modify brand voice analysis logic in "Analyze Brand Voice" node

**Scheduling:**

### ⚠️ Important Notes
