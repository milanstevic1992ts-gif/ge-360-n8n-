> 💡 **Pro Tip** — YouTube's API quotas can be a bottleneck when you're pulling data at scale. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/youtube) is a community node with dedicated scrapers for [channels](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/channels), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/videos), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/comments) — no quota limits, just structured data.

# 🎥 YouTube to LinkedIn Poster – n8n Workflow Template

Turn any YouTube video into a high-performing LinkedIn post — automatically.

This AI-powered n8n workflow takes a YouTube video ID, fetches the transcript using SearchAPI.io, and transforms it into a professional, engaging LinkedIn post using OpenAI (via OpenRouter). Customize the writing style, automate your content repurposing, and scale your thought leadership.

## 🚀 How I Used It in My MicroSaaS

I used this exact workflow as the backend for a lead magnet SaaS tool that converts YouTube videos into LinkedIn posts. With a simple UI and webhook, users paste a video link, choose a tone, and instantly receive a high-quality post they can copy and share. It increased lead generation and engagement while costing nothing in backend dev. Check it out here: **[Youtube -&gt; LinkedIn Post](https://trafficabc.com/youtube-to-linkedin-poster-with-ui/)**

The best part? I only used:

- n8n + Webhook

- SearchAPI.io

- OpenRouter API

- A WordPress front-end with credit gating
