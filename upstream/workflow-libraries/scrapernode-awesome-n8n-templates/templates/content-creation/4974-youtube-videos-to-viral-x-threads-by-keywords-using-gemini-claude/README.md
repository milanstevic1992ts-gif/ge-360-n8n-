# 🎬 YouTube Videos to Viral X Threads by Keywords (using Gemini & Claude)

> ⚡ **235 views** · 🎬 [Content Creation & Video](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

## Description

# Who is this for?
Content creators, marketers, and social media managers who want to turn high-performing YouTube videos into viral X (Twitter) threads using keywords (without manual research). Perfect for anyone looking to systematically create engaging social content from proven video sources.

---

# What problem does it solve?
Finding viral content ideas and writing engaging threads is time-consuming and hit-or-miss. This workflow automates the entire process: discovers high-performing YouTube videos based on your keywords, extracts key insights using AI, and generates multiple viral thread variations using proven patterns from 12.5M+ view threads.

# How it works

| # | Node | Purpose |
|---|------|---------|
| 1 | **Form Trigger** | Captures your keyword, target audience, and content type preferences. |
| 2 | **YouTube Video Search** | Finds recent videos (April 2025+) matching your keyword, sorted by view count. |
| 3 | **Get Video Statistics** | Fetches detailed metrics (views, engagement) for discovered videos. |
| 4 | **Filter High-Performers** | Keeps only videos with 100K+ views and excludes YouTube Shorts. |
| 5 | **Top 5 Selection** | Limits to the best 2 videos to focus on proven winners. |
| 6 | **Save Video Candidates** | Logs discovered videos to Google Sheets for manual approval. |
| 7 | **Wait & Check Approval** | Pauses 30 seconds, then checks which videos you marked "Yes" for thread generation. |
| 8 | **Video Analysis (Gemini)** | Uses Google's Gemini AI to extract key insights, tools, and strategies from approved videos. |
| 9 | **Thread Generation (Claude)** | Applies viral thread database patterns to create 3 distinct thread variations using Claude Sonnet 4. |
| 10 | **Structure & Save Threads** | Formats the generated threads and saves them back to Google Sheets for review and posting. |

# Setup steps

1. **Import & configure credentials**
  * Import the JSON workflow into n8n
  * Add your **YouTube Data API** key (get from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/))
  * Add your **Google Gemini API** key (get from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/))
  * Connect **Anthropic API** for Claude access
  * Set up **Google Sheets OAuth2** credential

2. **Create your tracking spreadsheet**
  * The workflow auto-creates a sheet with columns: `Keyword`, `Youtube video title`, `Description`, `Video URL`, `Turn into thread?`, `Thread 1`, `Thread 2`, `Thread 3`
  * You'll manually review and mark videos "Yes" in the `Turn into thread?` column

3. **Configure the viral thread database**
  * The workflow includes proven patterns from threads with 12.5M+ views
  * Adjust the target audience and content style in the AI prompts if needed

4. **Test the workflow**
