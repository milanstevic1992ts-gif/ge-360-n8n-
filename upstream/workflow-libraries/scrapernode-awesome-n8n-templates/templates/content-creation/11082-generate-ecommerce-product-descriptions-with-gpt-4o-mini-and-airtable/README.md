## 📊 Description
Automate your eCommerce content workflow by generating AI-optimized product descriptions directly from Airtable. 🛍️🤖 This automation checks for pending products every 15 minutes, processes them in batches, and uses GPT-4o-mini to create structured long descriptions, short answer blocks, bullet features, and feature tables. All AI-generated fields are then written back into the same Airtable record, ensuring clean, consistent, and SEO-friendly product copy. Perfect for stores looking to scale product listings without manual writing. ✨📄
