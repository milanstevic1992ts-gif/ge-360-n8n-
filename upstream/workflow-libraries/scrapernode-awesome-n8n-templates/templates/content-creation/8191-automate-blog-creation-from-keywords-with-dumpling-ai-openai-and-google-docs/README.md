> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

### Who is this for?  
This workflow is perfect for content marketers, bloggers, SEO professionals, and virtual assistants who need to transform keyword research into complete blog posts without spending hours writing and formatting.  

---  

### What problem is this workflow solving?  
Writing a blog post from scratch requires research, summarizing content, and structuring it into a polished article. This workflow automates that process by taking a single keyword, fetching related news articles, cleaning the data, and generating a professional blog draft automatically in Google Docs.  

---  

### What this workflow does  
The workflow begins when a keyword is submitted through a form. It expands the keyword into trending suggestions using Dumpling AI Autocomplete, then fetches recent news articles with Dumpling AI Google News. Articles are filtered to only include those published within the last 1–2 days, then scraped and cleaned for quality text. The aggregated content is sent to OpenAI, which generates a polished blog draft with a clear title. Finally, the draft is saved directly into Google Docs for easy editing and publishing.
