> 💡 **Pro Tip** — YouTube's API quotas can be a bottleneck when you're pulling data at scale. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/youtube) is a community node with dedicated scrapers for [channels](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/channels), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/videos), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/comments) — no quota limits, just structured data.

## Description

## What this workflow does

Transform YouTube videos into structured Active Learning study sheets using AI. 

This workflow extracts video metadata, transcribes audio with Google Gemini, applies the ICAP Framework (Interactive, Constructive, Active, Passive) for deep learning, and generates micro-goals, Cornell notes, Feynman explanations, and practice tasks—all automatically formatted in Notion.

Perfect for students, educators, and lifelong learners who want to maximize retention from video content.
