## AI-Powered Product Research & SEO Content Automation

Skip the guesswork and manual effort — this n8n flow automates the entire process of researching your product's online competition and generating high-quality SEO content. Whether you're launching a new product or optimizing existing listings, this workflow leverages **real-time web data** and **AI-driven copywriting** to deliver:

- 📈 Search-optimized metadata (Title, Description, Keywords)  
- 🛍️ Engaging product descriptions tailored for marketing  
- 📊 Auto-organized output ready for use in your content or e-commerce platform

All of this happens with just one product title input!

---

### 🧠 How It Works
• User submits a product title via a form.  
• The workflow uses Google Custom Search to gather real-time competitor content based on that title.  
• Titles, snippets, and keywords are extracted from the search results.  
• This information is sent to a language model (Google Gemini via LangChain) to generate:  
   - SEO-optimized metadata (Title, Description, Keywords)  
   - A compelling product description tailored for marketing  
• The AI-generated content is then parsed and organized into two categories: SEO data and product content.  
• The structured output is saved automatically into a connected Google Sheet for easy access or further automation.

### 🛠️ What Problems Does This Solve?
Manual competitor research and writing SEO content from scratch can be:
- **Time-consuming**
- **Inconsistent in quality**
- **Not optimized for search engines**

This workflow **automates** the entire research + writing + structuring process.
