## Description

This AI Blog Generator is an advanced n8n-powered automation workflow that leverages Google Gemini and Google Sheets to generate SEO-friendly blog articles for Shopify products. It automates the entire process — from fetching product data to creating structured HTML content — with zero manual effort.

## 💡 Key Advantages

Our AI Blog Generator offers five core advantages that make it the perfect solution for automated content creation:

- **🔗 Shopify Product Sync** — Automatically pulls product data (titles, descriptions, images, etc.) via Shopify API.
- **✍️ SEO Blog Generation** — Gemini generates blog titles, meta descriptions, and complete articles using product information.
- **🗂️ Structured Content Output** — Creates well-formatted HTML with headers and bullet points for seamless Shopify blog integration.
- **📄 Google Sheets Integration** — Tracks blog creation and prevents duplicate publishing using a centralized Google Sheet.
- **📤 Shopify Blog API Integration** — Publishes the generated blog to Shopify with a single API call.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The workflow follows a systematic 8-step process that ensures quality and efficiency:

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Manual Trigger** – Start the workflow via a test trigger or scheduler.
2. **Fetch Products from Shopify** – Retrieves all product details, including images and descriptions.
3. **Fix Input Format** – Organizes and updates the input table using Code and Google Sheet nodes.
4. **Filter Duplicates** – Ensures no previously used rows are processed again.
5. **Limit Control** – Processes one row at a time and loops until all blogs are posted.
6. **Gemini AI Generation** – Creates SEO-friendly blog content in HTML format from product data.
7. **HTML Structure Fix** – Adjusts content for JSON compatibility by cleaning unsupported HTML tags.
8. **Article API Posting** – Sends finalized blog content to Shopify for publishing or drafting.
