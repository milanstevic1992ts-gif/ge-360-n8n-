> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

## Description

## Who this workflow is for

This workflow is designed for content creators, marketing teams, and automation builders who want to produce short-form video content at scale without manual editing.

It is especially useful for teams posting consistently to YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, or TikTok who want a repeatable, automated content pipeline driven by AI.

## What this workflow does

This n8n automation converts a single Telegram message into a fully generated short-form video using AI.

When a message is sent to a Telegram bot, the workflow:
- Generates a structured short-form video script using Gemini
- Creates multiple cinematic video clips using VEO
- Merges clips into a single short video
- Generates a title, description, and hashtags optimized for short-form platforms
- Delivers the finished video asset and metadata back to Telegram or storage

The entire process runs automatically without requiring manual scripting, editing, or clip assembly.

## How the workflow works

1. A Telegram message triggers the workflow with a short content idea
2. An AI model generates a multi-part script optimized for short-form video
3. Video clips are generated for each script segment using VEO
4. Clips are merged into a final vertical video
5. Metadata (title, description, hashtags) is generated and attached
6. The completed short is delivered for review or publishing

1. Connect your Telegram bot credentials
2. Configure your Gemini and VEO credentials
