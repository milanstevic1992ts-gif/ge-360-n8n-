## Description

## How it works

This workflow automatically captures website visitors using Albacross, enriches their data with Datagma, and syncs it into HubSpot. Once leads are created or updated, a personalized email is generated and sent through Gmail. All email activities are logged in HubSpot for proper sales tracking and follow-up.

## Step-by-step

- **Schedule Trigger** – Runs the workflow at set intervals (hourly, daily, or custom).  

**2. Capture website visitors**  
- **Albacross Website Visitor** – Pulls company and visitor details from website activity.  

**3. Enrich lead data**  
- **Enrich Lead Data** – Enhances visitor records with personal and professional details via Datagma.  

**4. Sync to CRM**  
- **Create/Update HubSpot Contact** – Creates or updates contact records in HubSpot with enriched lead data.  

**5. Generate personalized outreach**  
- **Generate Personalized Message** – Builds a tailored email including company, industry, and value propositions.  

**6. Send and track emails**

- **Log Email Activity in HubSpot** – Tracks email engagement automatically in HubSpot.
