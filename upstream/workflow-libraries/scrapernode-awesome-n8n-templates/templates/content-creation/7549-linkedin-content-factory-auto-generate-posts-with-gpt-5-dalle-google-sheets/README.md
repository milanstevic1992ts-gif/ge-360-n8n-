## Description

Overview

Tired of cookie-cutter “AI LinkedIn post generators”? This workflow goes beyond just text generation — it orchestrates the entire lifecycle of a LinkedIn post. From idea capture to deduplication, from GPT-powered drafting to automatic image generation and link storage, it creates ready-to-publish posts while keeping your content unique and audit-friendly.

What does this workflow do?

This workflow:

Captures Ideas & Briefs – Inputs are logged in Google Sheets with audience, goals, and angles.

Deduplicates Smartly – Avoids repeating hooks or ideas with fuzzy GPT-based dedupe + GSheet logs.

Generates Posts – GPT (OpenAI) drafts sharp LinkedIn-ready posts based on your brief.

Creates Images – Post hook + body is sent to an Image Gen model (DALL·E / SDXL) → PNG asset.

Stores & Links – Final text + image uploaded to Google Drive with shareable links.

Audit Trail – GSheets keeps full history: raw idea, draft, final post, assets, notes.

Why is this useful?

Most “AI post generators” just spit out text. This workflow builds a real publishing pipeline:

🔄 No duplicates → keeps posts fresh & original.

🖼 Images included → auto-generated visuals increase engagement on LinkedIn.

📊 Audit-ready → every post has a traceable log in Sheets.

⚡ Fast iteration → from half-baked thought → polished post in minutes.

Tools used

n8n (Orchestrator): Automates triggers, merges, retries, and Google connectors.

OpenAI (LLM): Idea generation, drafting, fuzzy dedupe, and voice conformity.

Google Sheets: Source of truth — stores ideas, dedupe logs, audit trail.

Google Drive: Stores rendered images and shares links for publishing.

Image Generation (DALL·E / SDXL): Creates header graphics from hook + body.

Who is this for?

🧑‍💻 Product Managers / Founders who want to post consistently but don’t have time.

🎨 Creators who want to add unique visuals without hiring a designer.

⚙️ n8n Builders who want to see how AI + automation + storage can be stitched into one pipeline.
