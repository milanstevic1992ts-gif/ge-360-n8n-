## Description

![image.png](fileId:3296)

This workflow transforms any video you drop into a Google Drive folder into a ready-to-publish YouTube upload. It analyzes the video with AI to craft 3 high-CTR title ideas, 3 long SEO-friendly descriptions (with timestamps), and 10–15 optimized tags. It then generates 4 thumbnail options using your face and lets you pick your favorite before auto-publishing to YouTube via Upload-Post.


### Who Is This For?
- **YouTube Creators & Editors:** Ship videos with winning titles, thumbnails, and SEO in minutes.
- **Agencies & Media Teams:** Standardize output and speed across channels and clients.
- **Founders & Solo Makers:** Maintain consistent publishing with minimal manual work.

### What Problem Does It Solve?

4. **User Review #1:** Pick your favorite concept in a simple form.
5. **Thumbnail Generation (fal.ai):** Creates 4 thumbnails using your face (provided image URL).
