> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

## Description

## Who is this for?
Content creators, digital marketers, and social media managers who want to automate the creation of short-form videos for platforms like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels without extensive video editing skills.
## What problem does this workflow solve?
Creating engaging short-form videos consistently is time-consuming and requires multiple tools and skills. This workflow automates the entire process from ideation to publishing, significantly reducing the manual effort needed while maintaining content quality.
## What this workflow does
This all-in-one solution transforms ideas into fully produced short-form videos through a 5-step process:

1. **Generate video captions** from ideas stored in a Google Sheet
2. **Create AI-generated images** using Flux and the OpenAI API
3. **Convert images to videos** using Kling's API
4. **Add voice-overs** to your content with Eleven Labs
5. **Complete the video production** with Creatomate by adding templates, transitions, and combining all elements

The workflow handles everything from sourcing content ideas to rendering the final video, and even notifies you on Discord when videos are ready.
