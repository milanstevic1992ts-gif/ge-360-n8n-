# 🎬 Auto-generate WordPress articles from news with Claude AI and LinkedIn sharing

> ⚡ **846 views** · 🎬 [Content Creation & Video](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

## **How it works**
* This workflow sources news from news websites.
* The information is then passed to an LLM, which processes the article's content.
* An editor approves or rejects the article.
* If accepted, the article is first published on the WordPress site and then on the LinkedIn page.

## **Setup Instructions**

**1. Credentials**
You'll need to add credentials for the following services in your n8n instance:
* **News API**: A credential for your chosen news provider.
* **LLM**: Your API key for the LLM you want to use.
* **Google OAuth**: For both Gmail and Google Sheets.
* **WordPress OAuth2**: To publish articles via the API. See the [WordPress Developer Docs](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/).
* **LinkedIn OAuth2**: To share the post on a company page.

**2. Node Configuration**
Don't forget to:
* **Fetch News (HTTP Request)**: Set the query parameters (keywords, language, etc.) for your news source.
* **Basic LLM Chain**: Review and **customize the prompt** to match your desired tone, language, and style.
* **Approval request (Gmail)**: Set your email address in the `Send To` field.
* **HTTP Request WP - Push article**: Replace `&lt;site_Id&gt;` in the URL with your WordPress Site ID.
* **getImageId (Code Node)**: Update the array with your image IDs from the WordPress Media Library.
* **Create a post (LinkedIn)**: Enter your LinkedIn `Organization ID`.
* **Append row in sheet (Google Sheets)**: Select your Google Sheet file and the target sheet.
* **All Email Nodes**: Make sure the `Send To` field is your email.
