## Description

# Prompt-to-Image Generator & WordPress Uploader (n8n Workflow)

This workflow generates high-quality AI images from text prompts using **Leonardo AI**, then automatically uploads the result to your WordPress media library and returns the final image URL.

It functions as a **Modular Content Production (MCP) tool** - ideal for AI agents or workflows that need to dynamically generate and store visual assets on-demand.

  Uses Leonardo AI to create 1472x832px images from any text prompt, with enhanced contrast and style UUID preset.

- ☁️ **WordPress Media Upload**  
  Uploads the image as an attachment to your connected WordPress site via REST API.

- ☁️ **Twitter Media Upload**  
  Uploads the image to twitter so that you can post the image later on to X.com using the media_id

- 🔗 **Returns Final URL**  
  Outputs the publicly accessible image URL for immediate use in websites, blogs, or social media posts.

- 🔁 **Workflow-Callable (MCP Compatible)**  
  Can be executed standalone or triggered by another workflow. Acts as an image-generation microservice for larger automation pipelines.
