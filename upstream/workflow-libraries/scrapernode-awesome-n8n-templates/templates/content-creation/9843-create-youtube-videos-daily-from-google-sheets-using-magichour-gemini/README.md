> 💡 **Pro Tip** — YouTube's API quotas can be a bottleneck when you're pulling data at scale. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/youtube) is a community node with dedicated scrapers for [channels](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/channels), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/videos), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/youtube/scrapers/comments) — no quota limits, just structured data.

📅 100 Daily Prompts Automation

You can scale this workflow to generate one video per day from a batch of 100 prompts in Google Sheets.

Setup Steps

Add 100 prompts to your Google Sheet — one per row.

Set the Status column for each to Pending.

Use a Cron Trigger in n8n to run the workflow once daily (e.g., at 9 AM).

Each run picks one Pending prompt, generates a video, uploads to YouTube, then marks it as Done.

Continues daily until all 100 prompts are processed.

Example Cron Expression
0 9 * * *


→ Runs the automation every day at 9:00 AM.

Node Sequence
[Schedule Trigger (Daily)] → [Get Pending Prompt from Sheets]
→ [Gemini Prompt Parser] → [MagicHour Video Generation]
→ [Optional: MediaFX Audio Mix] → [Gemini Metadata Generator]
→ [YouTube Upload] → [Update Row in Sheets]


💡 Optional Enhancements:

Add a notification node (Slack, Discord, or Email) after each upload.

Add a counter check to stop after 100 videos.

Add a “Paused” column to skip specific rows.

🧠 Gemini Integration

Gemini handles:

JSON parsing for MagicHour requests

Metadata generation (title, description, tags)

Optional creative rewriting of prompts

🎧 Audio Mixing (Optional)

Install MediaFX Community Node
→ Settings → Community Nodes → n8n-nodes-mediafx

Use it to blend background music automatically into videos.

🪶 Error Handling

Avoid “Continue on Fail” in key nodes

Use IF branches for MagicHour API errors

Add retry/timeout logic for polling steps

🧱 Node Naming Tips

Rename generic nodes for clarity:

Merge → Merge Video & Audio

If → Check Video Completion

HTTP Request → MagicHour API Request

🚀 How to Use

Add MagicHour, Gemini, YouTube, and Sheets credentials

Replace background music with your own track

Use Google Sheets trigger or daily cron for automation

Videos are created, uploaded, and logged — hands-free
