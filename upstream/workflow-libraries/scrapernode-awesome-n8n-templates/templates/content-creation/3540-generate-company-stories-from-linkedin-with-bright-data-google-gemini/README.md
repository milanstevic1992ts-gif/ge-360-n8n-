> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

### Who this is for?

The LinkedIn Company Story Generator is an automated workflow that extracts company profile data from LinkedIn using Bright Data's web scraping infrastructure, then transforms that data into a professionally written narrative or story using a language model (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini). The final output is sent via webhook notification, making it easy to publish, review, or further automate.

This workflow is tailored for:​
