# 🎬 Generating AI videos with VEO3 and distributing with Blotato across multiple platforms

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

# Create and Auto-Post Viral AI Videos with VEO3 and Blotato to 9 Platforms

### Who is this for?

This template is ideal for content creators, growth marketers, e-commerce entrepreneurs, and video-first brands who want to automate the creation and multi-platform distribution of viral short-form ads using AI.

If you're looking to scale video production without editing tools or posting manually, this is for you.

### What problem is this workflow solving?

Creating high-converting video content is time-consuming. You need to:
- Come up with ideas
- Write compelling scripts
- Generate visuals
- Adapt content for each platform
- Manually publish and track results

This workflow automates that entire process and turns a single idea into a ready-to-publish video campaign across 9 platforms.

### What this workflow does

1. **Triggers** via Telegram when a new video idea is submitted  
2. **Fetches parameters** (style, tone, duration) from Google Sheets  
3. **Generates the video script** using GPT-4 and a master AI prompt  
4. **Creates the video** using Google’s VEO3 video generation model  
5. **Downloads the final video** once rendering is complete  
6. **Rewrites the caption** with GPT-4o for platform-optimized posting  
7. **Logs the result** in Google Sheets for tracking  
8. **Sends preview links** to Telegram for review  
9. **Auto-posts** the video to 9 platforms using Blotato (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Threads, Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Bluesky)

### Setup

1. Install **n8n (self-hosted)** with Community Nodes enabled  
2. Connect your **Telegram Bot Token** to the trigger node  
3. Add your **OpenAI API Key** for GPT-4 and GPT-4o models  
4. Configure your **VEO3 API access** (Google AI Studio)  
5. Set up **Blotato** with your platform tokens & IDs  
6. Link your **Google Sheets** and set the expected column structure (idea, style, caption, etc.)  
7. Adjust the Telegram trigger format (e.g., `idea: ...`) to your team’s input style

### How to customize this workflow to your needs

- Edit the **master prompt** to match your brand voice or industry  
- Replace the **caption prompt** to generate more marketing-style hooks  
- Modify the **platform list** if you only publish to a few specific channels  
- Add approval steps (Slack, email, Telegram) before publishing  
- Integrate tracking by pushing published URLs to your analytics or CRM
