## Description

MCP Tool — Replicate (Flux) Image Generator → WordPress/Twitter

Generates images via **Replicate** Flux models and uploads to WordPress (and optionally Twitter/X). Built to act as an **MCP** module that other agents/workflows call for on-demand image creation.

- Models configured in this workflow:\
  `black-forest-labs/flux-schnell`, `black-forest-labs/flux-dev`, `black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro`
- Switch rationale: **lower cost** 💰, **broader model choice** 🎯, **full control of parameters** ⚙️
- Leonardo API credits cannot be used in the **web UI** 🙅‍♂️; separate spend for API vs UI

## 🔄 Flow

1. Trigger with `prompt`, `slug`, `model`
2. Build model payload (quality/steps/ratio/output format)
3. Call Replicate: `POST /v1/models/{model}/predictions` (Prefer: wait)
4. Download the generated image URL
5. Upload to WordPress (returns public URL)
6. Optional: upload to Twitter/X
7. Return URL + metadata

## 🤖 MCP Use at Scale (emp0.com)

Operational pattern: I currently use this setup for my blog where i generate **~300 posts/month**, each with **4 images** (banner + 2 to 3 inline images) → **~1,000 images/month** produced by this MCP.

💡 **Hybrid Cost-Optimized Setup:**

- **High-priority images** (banners, main visuals): Generated using **Flux Dev** on Leonardo for slightly better prompt adherence.
- **Low-priority images** (inline blog visuals): Generated using **Flux Schnell** on Replicate for maximum cost efficiency.

- **Flux Dev (Leonardo)** = 7 credits
- **Flux 1.1 Pro equivalent in Leonardo** = **Leonardo Phoenix** based on my experience  = 10 credits

## 📊 Monthly Cost Example (1,000 images/month)

Mix: **300 ×`flux-dev` on Leonardo**, 
**700 ×`flux-schnell` on Replicate**.

| Platform/Model           | Images | Price per Image | Total      |
| ------------------------ | ------ | --------------- | ---------- |
| Leonardo `flux-dev`      | 300    | $0.0180        | **$5.40** |
| Replicate `flux-schnell` | 700    | $0.0030        | **$2.10** |
| **Total Monthly Spend**  | 1000   | —               | **$7.50** |

💵 **If using Leonardo for both:**

- 300 × $0.0180 = $5.40
- 700 × $0.0180 = $12.60
- **Total = $18.00**

**Savings:** $10.50/month (**≈58% lower**) with the hybrid setup.
