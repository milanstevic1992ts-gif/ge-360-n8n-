# **Animate Any Face into a Video with Fal.ai**
*Create stunning deepfake-style videos automatically by swapping a face from an image onto a source video.*

This workflow provides a powerful, automated pipeline to perform video face-swapping using the Fal.ai API. It's designed to handle the entire asynchronous process: accepting a source video and a target face image, uploading them to cloud storage, initiating the AI job, polling for completion, and retrieving the final, rendered video.

| **Services Used** | **Features** |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🤖 **Fal.ai** | Leverages the powerful Wan 2.2 model for high-quality face animation. |
| ☁️ **AWS S3** | Uses enterprise-grade cloud storage for reliable public file hosting. |
| 🔄 **Polling Loop** | Intelligently waits for the asynchronous AI job to complete before proceeding. |
| 📥 **n8n Form Trigger** | Provides a simple UI to upload your source image and video. |

## How It Works ⚙️

1.  **📥 Get User Input**: The workflow starts when you upload a source video and a face image via the **n8n Form Trigger**.
2.  **☁️ Upload to Cloud**: Both files are automatically uploaded to a specified **AWS S3 bucket** to generate the publicly accessible URLs required by the AI model.
3.  **🚀 Start AI Job**: The public URLs for the video and image are sent in an **HTTP Request** to the Fal.ai API, which starts the asynchronous face animation process and returns a `request_id`.
4.  **⏳ Wait & Check**: The workflow enters a polling loop. It **Waits** for one minute, then makes another **HTTP Request** to the Fal.ai status endpoint using the `request_id`.
5.  **✅ Check for Completion**: An **IF** node checks if the job status is `COMPLETED`. If not, the workflow loops back to the Wait node.
6.  **🎬 Retrieve Final Video**: Once the job is complete, the workflow makes a final **HTTP Request** to fetch the finished animated video.

## 🛠️ How to Set Up

1.  **🔑 Set Up Fal.ai Credentials**: Get your API Key from [Fal.ai](https://fal.ai/). In n8n, go to **Credentials**, add a new **Header Auth** credential, and save your key. Connect this credential to all three `HTTP Request` nodes in the workflow.
2.  **☁️ Configure AWS S3**: Add your AWS credentials in n8n. In the two **AWS S3** nodes (`Upload Video1` and `Upload Image1`), update the **Bucket Name** parameter to your own S3 bucket. Ensure your bucket permissions allow for public reads.
3.  **▶️ Activate and Run**: Activate the workflow. Open the **Form Trigger** URL from the n8n editor, upload your files, and submit. The final video will be available in the execution log of the `Get Final Video` node.

## Requirements

*   An active **Fal.ai** account and API key.
*   An **AWS account** with an S3 bucket configured for public access.
*   **Alternative Storage:** For a personal setup, you can replace the AWS S3 nodes with **Cloudinary** nodes. Just ensure the output is a public URL.
