> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

# Convert Viral Videos into AI Avatar Swaps and Publish on TikTok with Blotato

![Workflow Overview](https://www.dr-firas.com/wan.png)

### Who is this for?
This workflow is designed for content creators, agencies, influencers, and automation builders who want to transform viral videos into personalized avatar-based edits — and automatically publish them on TikTok (and other platforms) without manual editing or video software.

### What problem is this workflow solving?
Replacing a character in a video, transforming the voice, merging audio/video, and publishing to social networks typically requires multiple tools, editing skills, and a lot of time.  
This workflow automates the entire pipeline end-to-end:

- No manual video editing  
- No audio processing  
- No API debugging  
- No uploading/publishing hassles  

It’s a full AI-powered transformation system that produces ready-to-post content in minutes.

### What this workflow does
This workflow receives an avatar image + a viral video URL and automatically:

1. Extracts the audio using Replicate  
2. Replaces the character in the video using **FAL WAN Replace**  
3. Transforms the voice using **FAL Chatterbox Speech-to-Speech**  
4. Merges the new video and audio using **FAL FFmpeg**  
5. Saves results to Google Sheets for tracking  
6. Publishes the final video to **TikTok** via Blotato (and optionally to Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, X, and YouTube)  
7. Sends a confirmation message when publishing is complete

Everything runs automatically, in parallel, for maximum speed.

### Setup
1. **Telegram Bot**  
   - Add your Telegram Bot credentials in the **Telegram Trigger** node.  
   - Send an avatar photo + video URL in one message (URL in the caption).

2. **Workflow Configuration**  
   - Add your **FAL API key**  
   - Add your **Replicate API key**  
   - Add your **targetVoiceAudioUrl** (this is the voice the output will use)

3. **Google Sheets**  
   - Connect your Google Sheets OAuth credentials  
   - Select your sheet and ensure columns exist (e.g. original URL, output URL)

4. **Blotato Publishing**  
   - Install community node `@blotato/n8n-nodes-blotato`  
   - Connect your [Blotato](https://blotato.com/?ref=firas) API credentials  
   - Select the TikTok account (and optional other accounts)

5. **Test the workflow**  
   - Send a Telegram message with:
     - A photo (avatar)
     - Video URL in the caption  
   - The workflow will process everything automatically.

### How to customize this workflow to your needs
- **Change platforms**: remove or add publishing outputs (TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, X).  
- **Change voice style**: update the `targetVoiceAudioUrl` in the Workflow Configuration node.  
- **Use your own avatar**: send any image in Telegram — the workflow automatically makes it public and ready for AI processing.  
- **Adjust video logic**: swap FAL models, update merg
