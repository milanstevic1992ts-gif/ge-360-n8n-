> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

This automation flow is designed to generate professional, research-backed LinkedIn posts based on a user-submitted topic and audience, enhance it with a visually aligned image prompt, and then automatically send the post and image via Gmail and/or publish it to LinkedIn.
⚙️ How It Works (Step-by-Step):
1. 📝 Form Submission (Input Trigger)

    A user fills out a form with:

        Email

        Topic of the Post

        Target Audience

    This form submission acts as the entry point of the workflow (Form Trigger node).

2. 🤖 LinkedIn Post Generation Agent

    An AI agent is triggered that:

        Uses Tavily API to fetch real-time web search content related to the topic.

        Processes the topic and audience data using an Ollama Chat Model.

        Generates a well-structured LinkedIn post that includes:

            Hook

            Educational insight

            Professional tone

            Source citations

            Hashtags and call to action

3. 🎨 Image Prompt Agent

    The generated post is passed to a second agent that:

        Extracts the core message.

        Converts it into a graphic prompt using a different Ollama LLM.

        The prompt is written to be used by an image-generation model like DALL·E or Gemma/GPT-based image tools.

4. 🖼️ Image Generation

    The image prompt is passed to a local image generation endpoint (localhost:8098) or OpenAI (api.openai.com) to generate a visual asset.

    The base64 image is converted into a file.

5. 📩 Email Dispatch

    The post text and the generated image are then sent to the user’s email address via the Gmail node.

    The email includes:

        The full LinkedIn post

        The auto-generated image as an attachment

6. 🔗 LinkedIn Publishing (Optional)

    If OAuth is enabled, the post can also be published directly to LinkedIn using the LinkedIn node.
