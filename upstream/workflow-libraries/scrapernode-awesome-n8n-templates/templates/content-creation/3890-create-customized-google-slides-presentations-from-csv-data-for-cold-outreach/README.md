## Description

### 👥 Who Is This For?

Sales and marketing teams seeking efficient, hands‑free generation of personalized slide decks for each prospect from CSV lead lists.

### 🛠 What Problem Does This Solve?

Manually editing presentation decks for large lead lists is slow and error‑prone. This workflow fully automates:

* Importing and parsing CSV lead data
* Logging leads and outputs in Google Sheets
* Duplicating a master Slides template per lead
* Injecting lead‑specific variables into slides

### ⚙️ Pre‑conditions / Requirements

* n8n with Google Drive, Sheets, and Slides credentials
* A master Google Slides deck with placeholder tokens (e.g. {{Name}}, {{Company}})
* A Drive folder for incoming CSV lead files

### ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Import this workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Configure the New Leads Arrived node to watch your CSV folder.
3. Enter your Google credentials in the Drive, Sheets, and Slides nodes.
4. Specify the master Slides template ID in the Copy Slides Template node.
5. In Create Custom Presentation, map slide tokens to sheet column names.
6. Disable “Keep Binary Data” in Copy Slides Template to conserve memory.
7. Upload a sample CSV (with headers like Name, Company, Metric) to test.

### 🎨 How to Customize

* Add or remove variables by editing the CSV headers and updating the mapping in Merge Data for new Lead Document.
* Insert an AI/natural‑language node before slide creation to generate more advanced and personalized text blocks.
* Use SplitInBatches to throttle API calls and avoid rate‑limit errors.
* Add error‑handling branches to capture and log failed operations.

### 🔐 Security and Privacy

* The workflow uses placeholder variables for file and folder IDs, so no actual IDs are exposed in the template.
* Ensure OAuth scopes are limited to only the required Google APIs.
