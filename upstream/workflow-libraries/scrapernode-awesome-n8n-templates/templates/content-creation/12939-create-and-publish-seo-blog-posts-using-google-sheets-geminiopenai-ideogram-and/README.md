If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Workflow Node Breakdown

### Get_Post_Data
Fetches blog posting details from Google Sheets based on the current day. It pulls keywords, landing pages, domain IDs, and posting websites.

### get_client_status
Checks the client's project status from the project sheet. It verifies whether the client is active or inactive before proceeding further. This prevents publishing content for paused or stopped clients.

### PBN_Website_Access
Fetches WordPress website access details such as site URL, authentication token, and sitemap URL. These details are required for publishing posts, uploading images, and managing categories.

### Do the Research on the Topic
Performs deep SEO research on the target keyword. It analyzes search intent, content gaps, and audience needs. This ensures the generated content is informative, relevant, and SEO-optimized.

### sitemap_crawl (internal_linking)
Crawls the website sitemap to collect internal URLs. These URLs are later used for internal linking inside the blog content. Internal links help improve SEO and site structure.

### write_content
Uses AI to write an 800-1000 word SEO-optimized blog article based on research data. The content includes proper HTML formatting, internal links, and anchor keyword placement.

### extract_title_body

### classify_category
Automatically determines the most suitable category for the blog post by analyzing the blog title and content context. This keeps the website's category structure clean and relevant.

### get_category & create_category
Checks if the determined category exists in WordPress. If not, it creates a new category automatically.

### generate_image_prompt
Analyzes the blog content and generates AI prompts for creating relevant images including thumbnail and in-content images.

### Thumbnail Image Generator & Blog Image Generator
Generate high-quality images using Ideogram API based on AI-generated prompts. Images are created with proper resolution and rendering settings.

### Thumbnail Uploading & Blog Image Uploading
Upload generated images to WordPress media library and retrieve media IDs for post attachment.

### Add Alt Text in Images
Adds SEO-friendly alt text to uploaded images to improve accessibility and search engine optimization.

### Blog and Photo Merge
Merges the generated images into the blog content at appropriate positions within the article.

### publish_blog
Publishes the complete blog post to WordPress with title, content, category, featured image, and publish status.

### save_live_url
Saves the live published blog URL back into Google Sheets along with keyword, website URL, and timestamp for tracking and reporting.

### If Error Existed Then Get Notified
Sends instant Discord or Slack notifications when any error occurs during workflow execution, ensuring no failure goes unnoticed.

## Customization Options

- Change blog length or tone in the content generation node
- Modify image style or resolution in Ideogram nodes
- Add multi-site publishing using Switch nodes
