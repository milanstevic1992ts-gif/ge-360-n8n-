# 🚀 Automated Upwork Cover Letter Generator with n8n + MacOS Shortcut + Pinecone Context Retrieval

This `n8n` automation is designed to streamline the Upwork proposal process by generating highly personalized, context-aware cover letters using your own skills and project data stored in a Pinecone vector store.

With the help of an AI Agent powered by **Groq’s Qwen LLM**, and triggered instantly via a **MacOS Shortcut**, this system takes job descriptions from your clipboard and returns a ready-to-use HTML cover letter—right on your desktop.

## ⚙️ Workflow Breakdown

### 🔹 MacOS Shortcut – Trigger the Workflow Instantly
The process begins with a **MacOS Shortcut** that captures job description text from your clipboard and sends it to a custom webhook in `n8n`.

### 🔹 Webhook Node – Receive and Process Input
The **webhook node** receives the clipboard data, along with the required credentials for authentication. This node serves as the entry point to the full automation.

### 🔹 Field Mapping & Pre-Processing
A series of basic logic nodes map and clean up the input fields. These are then passed to an **LLM Chain** to generate specific questions related to the job description.

### 🔹 Question Answer Chain + Vector Search (Pinecone)
Using your previously stored skills and project data in a **Pinecone vector store**, the system retrieves relevant information to answer the generated questions and builds a rich context around the job description.

### 🔹 AI Agent Node – Generate Personalized Cover Letter
With both the job post and contextual data, the **AI Agent** (powered by **Groq’s Qwen LLM**) creates a tailored cover letter.  
The agent is equipped with:

- 🔍 Google Search Tool  
- 🧠 Vector Store Retriever Tool  
- 🗃️ Buffer Memory  

This ensures the generated proposal is **insightful**, **relevant**, and **professional**.

### 🔹 Markdown to HTML – Clean Output Conversion
The markdown output from the AI is converted into **HTML** using a **Markdown node**, making it easy to paste directly into Upwork or emails.

### 🔹 Return to Shortcut – Display Final Result
The final HTML response is sent back to the **MacOS Shortcut**, which displays it in a **modal window** for easy review and copy-paste.
