> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

## Description

## Who’s it for

This template is perfect for TikTok creators, content marketers, and social media teams who want to turn viral comments into engaging short-form videos without manually scripting, recording, or editing. If you want to keep up with trends and consistently publish high-quality avatar videos, this workflow automates the entire process from comment selection to enhanced final video.

## What it does

The workflow takes TikTok video URLs and their top comments from a Data Table, extracts the transcript using **Dumpling AI**, and uses **GPT-4** to write a natural and engaging TikTok script inspired by the comment. It then generates a full AI avatar video through **Captions.ai**, enhances it with subtitles and B-roll using **Submagic**, and finally saves all video details into **Airtable** for tracking.

Here’s what happens step by step:  
1. Pulls TikTok videos and their top comments from a Data Table  
2. Sends video URLs to **Dumpling AI** to retrieve transcripts  
3. Feeds both transcript and comment into **GPT-4** to generate a conversational TikTok script  
4. Cleans and formats the script using JavaScript  
5. Sends the script to **Captions.ai** to produce an AI avatar video  
6. Checks video status and retries if needed  
7. Enhances the final video with **Submagic** for captions and effects  
8. Receives the enhanced video via webhook and logs details into **Airtable**

## How it works

1. **Schedule Trigger**: Runs automatically at set intervals to start the workflow  
2. **Data Table**: Retrieves TikTok video URLs and associated comments  
3. **Dumpling AI**: Extracts transcripts from the video URLs  
4. **GPT-4**: Generates a compelling TikTok script based on the comment  
5. **JavaScript Node**: Cleans up script formatting for a smooth avatar generation  
6. **Captions.ai**: Creates an AI avatar video from the cleaned script  
7. **Wait & Check**: Monitors video creation status and retries if necessary  
8. **Submagic**: Enhances the video with captions, zooms, and B-roll effects  
9. **Webhook & Airtable**: Receives final video data and saves URL and ID for future use
