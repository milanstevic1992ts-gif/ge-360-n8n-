## Description

Transform raw product images into fully-optimized e-commerce listings in seconds. This workflow automates the bridge between a photo upload and a live product page by combining **UploadToURL** for hosting, **GPT-4o Vision** for content generation, and native integrations for **Shopify** and **WooCommerce**.

## 🎯 What This Workflow Does

Turns a single product photo into a comprehensive, SEO-ready store listing:

1. **📝 Captures Product Assets** - Receives an image via mobile upload (binary) or a remote URL via Webhook.
2. **☁️ Instant CDN Hosting** - **UploadToURL** hosts the image and generates a permanent, high-speed link for your store.
3. **👁️ Vision AI Analysis** - **GPT-4o Vision** "looks" at the product to generate titles, HTML descriptions, SEO tags, and even suggested categories.
4. **🚦 Smart Platform Routing** - Automatically detects your target platform and formats the data for:
   - **Shopify**: Creates products via GraphQL-compatible REST with full SEO metafields.
   - **WooCommerce**: Creates listings via REST API with Yoast SEO support and marketing blurbs.
5. **📊 Data Enrichment** - Sanitizes SKUs, coerces pricing, and maps inventory data for a production-ready entry.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Zero-Copywriting Required**: AI generates 5-point bullet features, SEO titles (max 70 chars), and rich HTML descriptions.
- **Dual-Platform Support**: Toggle between Shopify and WooCommerce within a single workflow.

## 🏆 Use Cases

### High-Volume Inventory
A warehouse team snaps photos of 50 new arrivals; the workflow creates 50 draft listings with descriptions and prices ready for final approval.

### Competitor Migration
Input a list of product image URLs from a supplier site; the AI re-writes all titles and descriptions to ensure unique content for SEO.

### Boutique E-commerce
Small business owners can manage their entire store from their smartphone by simply "sharing" a photo to the n8n webhook.

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **High-Res Images**: Better image quality results in significantly more accurate AI feature extraction.
