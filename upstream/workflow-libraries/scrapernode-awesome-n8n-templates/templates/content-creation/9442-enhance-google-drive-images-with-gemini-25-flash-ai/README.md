## Description

🚀 **Google Drive Image Enhancement with Gemini nano banana**
This workflow automates image enhancement by integrating **Google Drive** with **Google Gemini**. It fetches unprocessed images from a source folder, applies AI-driven transformations based on a customizable prompt (e.g., clean and realistic product backgrounds), and uploads the enhanced results into a destination folder—streamlining e-commerce catalog preparation or creative pipelines.

🔑 **Key Features**

* **Customizable Prompt Node** → Easily adjust the style/instructions for Gemini (e.g., backgrounds, lighting, focus).
* **Google Drive Integration** → Automatically fetches images from a source folder and uploads results to a target folder.
* **AI Processing via Gemini** → Converts original images to Base64, sends them with the prompt to Gemini, and returns enhanced versions.
* **Image Filtering** → Processes only files whose `mimeType` contains `"image"`.
* **Loop Handling** → Iterates over all images in the source folder until all are processed.

⚙️ **Setup Instructions**

1. **Configure Prompt**

   * Open the `promt` node.
   * Replace the text with your desired Gemini instructions (e.g., "Add a clean, realistic background for baby products").

2. **Set Google Drive Folders**

   * In `origin_folder` → set **Search Query** to the name of the source folder (with unprocessed images).
   * In `destination_folder` → set **Search Query** to the name of the target folder (to save results).

3. **Credentials**

   * Provide valid **Google Drive OAuth2** credentials for both Drive nodes.
   * Provide a **Google Gemini API** credential for the `banana-request` node.

4. **Run the Workflow**

   * Trigger from the `init` node.
   * Workflow will download → convert → send to Gemini → reconvert → upload results automatically.

🛠 **Customization Guidance**

* Modify the **prompt text** to change how Gemini processes the images (background, style, product focus).
* Swap `Search Query` for **folder IDs** in Drive nodes if you need more precise targeting.
* Extend the workflow by chaining post-processing (e.g., watermarking, resizing, or tagging metadata).
