> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

## Description

# YouTube Shorts Automation with AI-Powered Video Generation

## Overview

This workflow automates the creation of engaging YouTube Shorts by leveraging AI tools to generate scripts, audio, images, and videos, then compiles them into a final video ready for upload. It uses OpenAI for script and image prompt generation, ElevenLabs for text-to-speech, Replicate for image and video generation, Cloudinary for audio storage, and Creatomate for final video rendering. The workflow segments the script into 6-second clips, creates corresponding visuals, and combines them with audio, adding smooth transitions for a polished result.

## Why is this workflow useful?

Creating YouTube Shorts manually is time-consuming, requiring scriptwriting, voiceovers, and video editing. This workflow automates the entire process, enabling creators to produce high-quality, engaging Shorts in minutes. It’s ideal for content creators, marketers, or businesses looking to maintain a consistent social media presence with minimal effort.

## Who is this workflow for?

- **Content Creators**: YouTubers or TikTok creators aiming to produce viral Shorts quickly.
- **Digital Marketers**: Businesses promoting products or services through short-form video content.
- **Hobbyists**: Individuals experimenting with AI-driven video production without advanced editing skills.

## What will you need to use this workflow?

- **n8n Account**: Free or paid, hosted on n8n Cloud or self-hosted.
- **OpenAI API Key**: For generating scripts and image prompts (GPT-4o-mini model).
- **ElevenLabs API Key**: For text-to-speech conversion.
- **Replicate API Key**: For generating images and videos.
- **Cloudinary Account**: For storing audio files.
- **Creatomate API Key**: For rendering the final video.
- **Basic JSON Knowledge**: To understand and tweak the workflow output if needed.

## How does this workflow work?

1. **Trigger**: The workflow starts manually via the "Test Workflow" button.
2. **Script Generation**: OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini) generates a script with an intro (40-70 chars), base (280-350 chars), and CTA (55 chars), plus a title and description with hashtags.
3. **Text-to-Speech**: ElevenLabs converts the script into an MP3 audio file with timestamps.
4. **Audio Upload**: The audio is uploaded to Cloudinary for storage.
5. **Script Segmentation**: A Python script segments the audio into 6-second clips, creating transcription chunks.
6. **Image Prompt Generation**: OpenAI generates a visual prompt for each segment in the style of CNSTLL, ensuring simple, animatable visuals.
7. **Image Generation**: Replicate creates a 9:16 image for each segment based on the prompt.
8. **Video Generation**: Replicate’s Minimax model generates 5-second video clips from the images.
9. **Video Compilation**: Creatomate combines the video clips with the audio, adding fade transitions and a final black shape for a smooth close.
10. **Final Output**: The rendered video is retrieved from Creatomate, ready for YouTube Shorts.

## Setup instructions

1. **Import the Workflow**: Copy the provided JSON into n8n and import it as a new workflow.
2. **Add Credentials**:
   - Configure OpenAI API credentials for the "Ideator" and "Image Prompter" nodes.
   - Set up ElevenLabs API key in the "Script Generator" node.
   - Add Replicate API key for the "Request Image," "Request Video," and "Get Video" nodes.
   - Configure Cloudinary credentials for the "Upload to Cloudinary" node.
   - Set Creatomate API key for the "Editor" and "Get Final Video" nodes.
3. **Test the Workflow**:
   - Click "Test Workflow" to run it manually.
   - Replace `&lt;user-query&gt;` in the "Ideator" node with your video topic (e.g., "Fitness tips for beginners").
4. **Verify Outputs**: Check each node’s output, ensuring audio, images, and videos are generated correctly.
5. **Customize (Optional)**:
   - Adjust segment duration in the "HTTP Request" node’s Python code (default: 6 seconds).
   - Modify fade duration or video resolution in the "Create Editor JSON" node.
6. **Save and Activate**: Save the workflow and activate it for regular use.

## Tips for getting the most out of this workflow

- **Optimize Prompts**: Use specific, concise queries in the "Ideator" node for better script quality (e.g., "Minimalist home decor ideas").
- **Check API Limits**: Ensure your API accounts (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Replicate, Creatomate) have sufficient credits.
- **Experiment with Styles**: Tweak the CNSTLL style in the "Image Prompter" node for unique visuals, but keep prompts simple to avoid AI generation errors.
- **Monitor Rendering Time**: Video rendering in Creatomate may take up to 70 seconds; adjust the "Rendering" node’s wait time if needed.
- **Add Hashtags**: Enhance the generated description with trending hashtags like #YouTubeShorts, #AI, or niche-specific tags.

## Troubleshooting

- **Error in Script Generation**: Verify your OpenAI API key and ensure the query is clear.
- **Audio Issues**: Check ElevenLabs API key and confirm the script length fits within API limits.
- **Image/Video Failures**: Ensure Replicate API key is valid and prompts are simple (avoid complex scenes or humans).
- **Rendering Errors**: Confirm Creatomate API key and check JSON structure in the "Create Editor JSON" node.
- **Contact Support**: Reach out to n8n Community Forum or respective API providers for persistent issues.

## Built with

- **n8n Nodes**: Manual Trigger, OpenAI, HTTP Request, Set, Split Out, Aggregate, Merge, Wait.
- **External Services**: OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini), ElevenLabs (Multilingual v2), Replicate (Flux-Cinestill, Minimax Video-01), Cloudinary, Creatomate.
- **Custom Code**: Python for audio segmentation and JSON rendering.

## Example output

For a query like "Morning routine hacks":

- **Script**:
  - **Intro**: "Struggling to start your day right?"
  - **Base**: "Try these 3 morning hacks: 5-min meditation to clear your mind, a quick stretch routine to boost energy, and a cold shower to stay alert. Set your day up for success!"
  - **CTA**: "Save this and try it tomorrow!"
- **Title**: "3 Morning Hacks You NEED to Try!"
- **Description**: "Kickstart your day with these easy hacks! 🧘‍♀️🚿 #MorningRoutine #Productivity #YouTubeShorts"
- **Video**: A 15-second Short with three 5-second clips (meditation scene, stretching POV, cold shower close-up), synced with audio and fade transitions.
