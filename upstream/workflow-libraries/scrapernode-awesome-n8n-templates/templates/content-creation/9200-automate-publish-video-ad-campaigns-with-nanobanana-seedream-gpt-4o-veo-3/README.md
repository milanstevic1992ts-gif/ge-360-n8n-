> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

# 💥 Automate video ads with NanoBanana, Seedream 4, ChatGPT Image and Veo 3

### Who is this for?
This template is designed for **marketers, content creators, and e-commerce brands** who want to automate the creation of professional ad videos at scale. It’s ideal for teams looking to generate consistent, high-quality video ads for social media without spending hours on manual design, editing, or publishing.

### What problem is this workflow solving? / Use case
Creating video ads usually requires multiple tools and a lot of time: writing scripts, designing product visuals, editing videos, and publishing them across platforms.  
This workflow **automates the entire pipeline** — from idea to ready-to-publish ad video — ensuring brands can quickly test campaigns and boost engagement without production delays.

### What this workflow does
1. **Generates ad ideas** from Telegram input (text + product image).  
2. **Creates product visuals** using multiple AI image engines:  
   - 🌊 **Seedream 4.0** (realistic visuals)  
   - 🍌 **NanoBanana** (image editing & enhancement)  
   - 🤖 **ChatGPT Image / GPT-4o** (creative variations)  
3. **Produces cinematic video ads** with **Veo 3** based on AI-generated scripts.  
4. **Merges multiple short clips** into a polished final ad.  
5. **Publishes automatically** to multiple platforms (TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, X, Threads, Facebook, Pinterest, Bluesky, YouTube) via **Blotato**.  
6. **Stores metadata and results** in Google Sheets & Google Drive for easy tracking.  
7. **Notifies you via Telegram** with the video link and copy.

### Setup
1. **Connect your accounts** in n8n:
   - Telegram API (for input and notifications)  
   - Google Drive + Google Sheets (storage & tracking)  
   - Kie AI API (Seedream + Veo 3)  
   - Fal.ai API (NanoBanana + video merging)  
   - OpenAI (for script and prompt generation)  
   - Blotato API (for social publishing)  
2. **Prepare a Google Sheet** with brand info and settings (product name, category, features, offer, website URL).  
3. **Deploy the workflow** and connect your Telegram bot to start sending ad ideas (photo + caption).  
4. **Run the workflow** — it will automatically generate images, create videos, and publish to your chosen channels.

### How to customize this workflow to your needs
- **Brand customization**: Adjust the Google Sheet values to reflect your brand’s offers and product features.  
- **Platforms**: Enable/disable specific Blotato nodes depending on which platforms you want to publish to.  
- **Video style**: Edit the AI agent’s system prompt to control tone, format, and transitions (cinematic, playful, modern, etc.).  
- **Notifications**: Adapt Telegram nodes to send updates to different team members or channels.  
- **Storage**: Change the Google Drive folder IDs to store generated videos and images in your preferred location.  

This workflow lets you **go from idea → images → cinematic ad video → auto-published content** in minutes, fully automated.
