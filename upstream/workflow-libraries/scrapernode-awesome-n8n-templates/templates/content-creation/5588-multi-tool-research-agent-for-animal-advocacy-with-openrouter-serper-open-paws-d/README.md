## Description

This general-purpose sub-agent combines multiple research and automation tools to support high-impact decision-making for animal advocacy workflows. It’s designed to act as a reusable, modular unit within larger multi-agent systems—handling search, scraping, scoring, and domain-specific semantic lookup.

It powers many of the advanced workflows released by Open Paws and serves as a versatile backend utility agent.

## 🛠️ What It Does

- Performs real-time **Google Search** using Serper  
- Scrapes and extracts page content using **Jina AI** and **Scraping Dog**  
- Conducts **semantic search** over the Open Paws knowledge base  
- Generates **OpenAI embeddings** for similarity search and analysis  
- Routes search and content analysis through **OpenRouter LLMs**  
- Connects with downstream tools like the **Text Scoring Sub-Workflow** to evaluate message performance

&gt; 🧩 This agent is typically used as a **sub-workflow** in larger automations where agents need access to external tools or advocacy-specific knowledge.

## 🧠 Domain Focus: Animal Advocacy

The agent is pre-configured to interface with the Open Paws database—an open-source, animal advocacy-specific knowledge graph—and is optimized for content and research tasks relevant to farmed animal issues, corporate campaigns, and activist communication.
