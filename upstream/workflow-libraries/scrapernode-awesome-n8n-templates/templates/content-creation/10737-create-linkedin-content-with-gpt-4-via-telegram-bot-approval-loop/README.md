> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

AI LinkedIn Content Bot with Approval Loop

This n8n workflow transforms your Telegram messenger into a personal assistant for creating and publishing LinkedIn posts. You can simply send an idea as a text or voice message, collaboratively edit the AI's suggestion in a chat, and then publish the finished post directly to LinkedIn just by saying "Okay."

### What You'll Need to Get Started

Before you can use this workflow, you'll need a few prerequisites set up. This workflow connects three different services, so you will need API credentials for each:

1.  **Telegram Bot API Key:** You can get this by talking to the **"BotFather"** on Telegram. It will guide you through creating your new bot and provide you with the API token.

2.  **OpenAI API Key:** This is required for the "Speech to Text" and "AI Agent" nodes. You'll need an account with OpenAI to generate this key.
[OpenAI API Platform](https://platform.openai.com
)
3.  **Blotato API Key:** This service is used to publish the final post to LinkedIn. You'll need a Blotato account and to connect your LinkedIn profile there to get the key.

Once you have these keys, you can add them to the corresponding credentials in your n8n instance.

### How the Workflow Operates, Step-by-Step

Here is a detailed breakdown of how the workflow processes your request and handles the publishing.

### 1\. Input & Initial Processing

This phase captures your idea and converts it into usable text.

| Node Name | Role in Workflow |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Start: Telegram Message`** | This Telegram Trigger node initiates the entire process upon receiving any message from you in the bot. |
| **`Prepare Input`** | Consolidates the message content, ensuring the AI receives only one clean text input. |
| **`Check: ist it a Voice?`** | Checks the incoming message for text. If text is empty, it proceeds to voice handling. |
| **`Get Voice File`** | If a voice note is detected, this node downloads the raw audio file from Telegram. |
| **`Speech to Text`** | This node uses the OpenAI Whisper API to convert the downloaded audio file into a text string. |

### 2\. AI Core & Iteration Loop

This is the central dialogue system where the AI drafts the content and engages in the feedback loop.

| Node Name | Role in Workflow |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`AI: Draft & Revise Post`** | The main logic agent. It analyzes your request, applies the "System Prompt" rules, drafts the post, and handles revisions based on your feedback. |
| **`OpenAI Chat Model`** | Defines the large language model (LLM) used for generating and revising the post. |
| **`Window Buffer Memory`** | A memory buffer that stores the last turns of the conversation, allowing the AI to maintain context when you request changes (e.g., "Make it shorter"). |
| **`Check if Approved`** | This crucial node detects the specific JSON structure the AI outputs only when you provide an approval keyword (like "ok" or "approved"). |
| **`Post Suggestion Or Ask For Approval`** | Sends the AI's post draft back to your Telegram chat for review and feedback. |

### AI Agent System Prompt (Internal Instructions - English)

The agent operates under a strict prompt that dictates its behavior and formatting (found within the **`AI: Draft & Revise Post`** node):

&gt; **You are a LinkedIn Content Creator Agent for Telegram.**
&gt; Keep the confirmation process, but change the output format as follows:
&gt;
&gt; **Your Task**
&gt; Analyze the user's message:
&gt;
&gt;   * Topic
&gt;   * Goal (e.g., reach, show expertise, recruiting, personal branding, leads)
&gt;   * Target Audience
&gt;   * Tonality (e.g., factual, personal, bold, inspiring)
&gt;
&gt; **Create a LinkedIn post as ONE continuous text:**
&gt;
&gt;   * Strong hook in the first 1–2 lines.
&gt;   * Clear main part with added value, story, example, or insight.
&gt;   * Optional Call-to-Action (e.g., question to the community, invitation to exchange).
&gt;   * Integrate hashtags at the end of the post (5–12 suitable hashtags, mix of niche + somewhat broader).
&gt;   * Readable on LinkedIn: short paragraphs, emojis only sparingly.
&gt;
&gt; **Present the suggestion to the user in the following format:**
&gt;
&gt; **Headline: Post Proposal:**
&gt; Below that, the complete LinkedIn post (incl. hashtags at the end in the same text).
&gt;
&gt; **Ask for feedback:**
&gt; For example:
&gt; *"Any changes? (Tone, length, formality, personal vs. professional, more technical content, different hashtags?)"*
&gt;
&gt; **If the user requests changes:**
&gt; Adjust the post specifically based on the feedback.
&gt; Again, output only:
&gt; **Post Proposal:**
&gt; the revised complete post.
&gt;
&gt; **If the user says “approved”, “ok”, “sounds good”, or similar:**
&gt; Return **exclusively** this JSON, without additional text, without Markdown:
&gt;
&gt; ```json
&gt; {
&gt;   "Post": "The final LinkedIn post as one text, including hashtags at the end"
&gt; }
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; **Important:**
&gt;
&gt;   * Never output JSON before approval, only normal suggestion text.
&gt;   * The final output after approval consists of only one field: Post.

### 3\. Publishing & Status Check

Once approved, the workflow handles the publication and monitors the post's status in real-time.

| Node Name | Role in Workflow |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Approval: Extract Final Post Text`** | Parses the incoming JSON, extracting only the clean text ready for publishing. |
| **`Create post with Blotato`** | Uses the Blotato API to upload the finalized content to your connected LinkedIn account. |
| **`Give Blotat 5s :)`** | A brief pause to allow the publishing service to start processing the request. |
| **`Check post status`** | Checks back with Blotato to determine if the post is published, in progress, or failed. |
| **`Published?`** | Checks if the status is "published" to send the success message. |
| **`In Progress?`** | Checks if the post is still being processed. If so, it loops back to the next wait period. |
| **`Give Blotat other 5s :)`** | Pauses the workflow before re-checking the post status, preventing unnecessary API calls. |

### 4\. Final Notification

| Node Name | Role in Workflow |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Send a confirmation message`** | Sends a confirmation message and the direct link to the published LinkedIn post. |
| **`Send an error message`** | Sends a notification if the post failed to upload or encountered an error during processing. |

## 🛠️ Personalizing Your Content Bot

The true power of this n8n workflow lies in its flexibility. You can easily modify key components to match your unique brand voice and technical preferences.

### 1\. Tweak the Content Creator Prompt

The personality, tone, and formatting rules for your LinkedIn content are all defined in the System Prompt.

  * **Where to find it:** Inside the **`AI: Draft & Revise Post`** node, under the `System Message` setting.
  * **What to personalize:** Adjust the tone, change the formatting rules (e.g., number of hashtags, required emojis), or insert specific details about your industry or target audience.

### 2\. Switch the AI Model or Provider

You can easily swap the language model used for generation.

  * **Where to find it:** The **`OpenAI Chat Model`** node.
  * **What to personalize:**
      * **Model:** Swap out the default model for a more powerful or faster alternative (e.g., `gpt-4` family, or models from other providers if you change the node).
      * **Provider:** You can replace the entire Langchain block (including the `AI Model` and `Window Buffer Memory` nodes) with an equivalent block using a different provider's Chat/LLM node (e.g., Anthropic, Cohere, or Google Gemini), provided you set up the corresponding credentials and context flow.

### 3\. Modify Publishing Behavior (Schedule vs. Post)

The final step is currently set to publish immediately, but you might prefer to schedule posts.

  * **Where to find it:** The **`Create post with Blotato`** node.
  * **What to personalize:**
      * Consult the Blotato documentation for alternative operations. Instead of choosing the "Create Post" operation (which often posts immediately), you can typically select a "Schedule Post" or "Add to Queue" operation within the Blotato node.
      * If scheduling, you will need to add a step (e.g., a **Set** node or another agent prompt) before publishing to calculate and pass a `Scheduled Time` parameter to the Blotato node.
