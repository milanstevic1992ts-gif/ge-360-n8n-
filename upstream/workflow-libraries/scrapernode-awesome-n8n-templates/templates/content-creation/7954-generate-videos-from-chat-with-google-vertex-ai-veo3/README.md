Generate Videos from Chat with Google Vertex AI (Veo3) - Beginner Friendly

Description
Turn any text prompt into a short AI-generated video directly from an n8n chat. This workflow connects a chat trigger to Google Vertex AI’s Veo3 model, sending your prompt as input and polling until the rendered video is ready. Once complete, the video is converted into a downloadable file you can use anywhere. Perfect for experimenting with AI-driven media or automating creative video generation inside your workflows.

Post to Vertex AI (Veo3) – Sends the prompt to the Veo3 API with parameters like aspect ratio, duration, and resolution.

Wait + Poll Loop – Repeatedly checks the operation status until the video is finished.

If + Edit Fields – Extracts the base64 video response and metadata.

Convert to File – Turns the video into a binary file for download or use in further automations.
