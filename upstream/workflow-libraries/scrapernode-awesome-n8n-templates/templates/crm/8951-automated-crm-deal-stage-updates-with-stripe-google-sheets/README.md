## Description

## Description:
Keep your CRM always up to date by automatically syncing closed deals from Stripe into Google Sheets. This n8n workflow fetches all paid invoices, finds matching customer records in your CRM tracking sheet, removes duplicates, marks the deal as “Closed,” and updates the sheet in real time—eliminating manual updates and ensuring your sales pipeline reflects actual revenue.

## What This Template Does
-  ⏰ Scheduled Trigger (Cron): Runs automatically at your chosen frequency (daily/hourly) to check Stripe for new paid invoices.
- 💳 Fetch Paid Invoices from Stripe: Calls the Stripe API to retrieve all invoices with status = “paid.”
- 📋 Split Invoice Array: Breaks down the list of paid invoices into individual records for easier processing.
- 🔍 Find Customer in CRM Sheet: Looks up each Stripe customer email against your Google Sheets CRM tracker to fetch HubSpot/Pipedrive Deal IDs.
- 🧹 Clean Data & Mark as Closed (Code Node): Removes duplicates, filters out empty rows, and tags deals with status = “Closed” (customizable to “Won” or your CRM’s terminology).
- ✅ Update CRM Sheet with Closed Deals: Updates your Google Sheet by matching records via Stripe Email and marking them as closed while preserving existing CRM IDs.
- 📈 Full Sync Summary: At the end, your CRM sheet reflects all customers who have completed payments in Stripe, ensuring your pipeline and revenue reporting stay aligned.
