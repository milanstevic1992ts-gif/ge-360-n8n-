## Description

## 📘 Description:
This automation streamlines client review collection and sentiment summarization for Techdome using HighLevel CRM, Azure OpenAI GPT-4o, Gmail, Slack, and Google Sheets.
It starts by pulling recently won deals from HighLevel, then generates and sends AI-written HTML review request emails with built-in Google Review and feedback form links.
After waiting 24 hours, it fetches the client’s reply thread, summarizes the sentiment using GPT-4o, and posts a clean update to Slack for team visibility.
Any failures—API errors, empty responses, or data validation issues—are logged automatically to Google Sheets for full transparency and QA.
The result: a fully hands-free Client Appreciation + Feedback Intelligence Loop, improving brand perception and internal responsiveness.

⏳ Wait for 24 Hours Before Next Action
 Pauses the workflow for 24 hours to give clients time to read and respond to the review request.

📥 Retrieve Email Thread for Response (Gmail Node)
 After the waiting period, fetches the Gmail thread associated with the initial email to capture client replies or feedback messages.

🧠 Configure GPT-4o Model (Summarization Engine)
 Prepares another GPT-4o instance specialized for summarizing client replies into concise, sentiment-aware Slack messages.

💬 Summarize Client Feedback (AI Agent)
 Analyzes the Gmail thread and produces a short Slack-formatted summary using this structure:

🎉 *New Client Review Received!**Client:* &lt;Name&gt;

Focuses on tone clarity and quick readability for internal teams.
