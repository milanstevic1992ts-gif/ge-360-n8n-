**Community Node Disclaimer**: This workflow uses KlickTipp community nodes.

### How It Works

This workflow connects an MCP Server with the KlickTipp contact management platform and integrates it with an LLM (e.g. Claude etc.) to enable intelligent querying and segmentation of contact data. It covers all major KlickTipp API endpoints, providing a comprehensive toolkit for automated contact handling and campaign targeting.

### Key Features
**MCP Server Trigger:**
- Initiates the workflow via the MCP server, listening for incoming requests related to contact queries or segmentation actions.


**LLM Interaction Setup:**
- Interacts with an OpenAI or Claude model to handle natural language queries such as contact lookups, tagging, and segmentation tasks.


**KlickTipp Integration:**
Complete set of KlickTipp API endpoints included:
  - **Contact Management:** Add, update, get, list, delete, and unsubscribe contacts.
  - **Contact Tagging:** Tag, untag, list tagged contacts.
  - **Tag Operations:** Create, get, update, delete, list tags.
  - **Opt-In Processes:** List and retrieve opt-in process details.
  - **Data Fields:** List and get custom data fields.
  - **Redirects:** Retrieve redirect URLs.


**Use Cases Supported:**
- Query contact information via email or name.
- Identify and segment contacts by city, region, or behavior.
- Create or update contacts from the provided data.
- Dynamically apply or remove tags to initiate campaigns.
- Automate targeted outreach based on contact attributes.


### Setup Instructions
**Install and Configure Nodes:**
- Set up MCP Server.
- Configure the LLM connection (e.g., Claude Desktop configuration).
- Add and authenticate all KlickTipp nodes using valid API credentials.


**Define Tagging and Field Mapping:**
- Identify which fields and tags are relevant to your use cases.
- Ensure necessary tags and custom fields are already created in KlickTipp.


**Workflow Logic:**
1. **Trigger via MCP Server:** A prompt or webhook call activates the server listener.
2. **Query Handling via LLM Agent:** AI interprets the natural language input and determines the action.
3. **Contact Search & Segmentation:** Searches contacts using identifiers (email, address) or criteria.
4. **Data Operations:** Retrieves, updates, or manages contact and tag data based on interpreted command.
5. **Campaign Preparation:** Applies tags or sends campaign triggers depending on query results.


**Benefits:**
- **AI-Powered Automation:** Reduces manual contact search and tagging efforts through intelligent processing.
- **Scalable Integration:** Built-in support for full range of KlickTipp operations allows diverse use-case handling.
- **Data Consistency:** Ensures structured data flows between MCP, AI, and KlickTipp, minimizing errors.


**Testing and Deployment:**
Use defined prompts such as:
- “Tell me something about the contact with email address X”
- “Tag all contacts from region Y”
- “Send campaign Z to customers in area A”
Validate expected actions in KlickTipp after prompt execution.


**Notes:**
- **Customization:** Adjust tag logic, AI prompts, and contact field mappings based on project needs.
- **Extensibility:** The template can be expanded with further logic for Google Sheets input or campaign feedback loops
