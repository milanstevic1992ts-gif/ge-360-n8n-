## Build a Revenue Ops Meeting Pipeline with Pipedrive, Calendar, Slack

This workflow creates a **CRM-driven revenue operations meeting pipeline** that automatically coordinates meetings once a deal reaches a specific stage in **Pipedrive**.

When a deal moves into the *Meeting Booking* stage, the workflow waits for the SDR to complete the meeting details, creates the event in **Google Calendar**, sends a confirmation email to the client, and notifies the internal team in **Slack**.

The result is a reliable, no-manual-work system that ensures meetings are scheduled, confirmed, and communicated without human follow-up.

---

## Benefits

- **CRM as the Single Source of Truth**  
  All automation is triggered directly from deal stage changes.

- **Reduced No-Shows**  
  Clients receive timely meeting confirmations with correct links and times.

- **Zero Manual Coordination**  
  No copying links, sending reminders, or checking calendars.

- **Internal Visibility**  
  Sales teams receive Slack reminders automatically.

- **Time-Zone Safe Scheduling**  
  Meeting times are calculated and normalized automatically.

## How It Works

### Deal Stage Trigger (Pipedrive)

- Listens for deal updates in Pipedrive  
- Runs only when the deal enters the *Meeting Booking* stage  
- Prevents execution on irrelevant pipeline changes

---

### Controlled Wait Logic

- Pauses execution to allow the SDR to:
  - Add the meeting link
  - Set date, time, and duration
- Ensures data completeness before scheduling

---

### Data Extraction & Enrichment

- Fetches full deal details
- Extracts:
  - Client name and email
  - Company name
  - Meeting link
  - Meeting date and time
- Calculates ISO start and end times with time-zone handling

---

### Calendar Event Creation (Google Calendar)

- Creates a calendar event automatically
- Adds the client as an attendee
- Inserts the meeting link as the event location

---

### Client Email Confirmation

- Sends a personalized confirmation email
- Includes meeting date, time, and context
- Reduces rescheduling and confusion

---

### Internal Slack Notification

- Sends a reminder to a selected Slack channel
- Notifies SDRs and sales managers of upcoming meetings
- Keeps teams aligned without CRM checking
