> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

## Description

# How it works

It’s very important to come prepared to Sales calls. This often means a lot of manual research about the person you’re calling with. This workflow delivers a summary of the latest social media activity (LinkedIn + X) for businesses you are about to interact with each day.

- **Scans Your Calendar**: Each morning, it reviews your Google Calendar for any scheduled meetings or calls with companies based on each attendee email address.
- **Fetches Latest Posts**: For each identified company, it fetches recent LinkedIn and X posts and summerizes them using AI to deliver a qucik overview for a busy sales rep.
- **Delivers Insights**: You receive personalized emails via Gmail, each dedicated to a company you’re meeting with that day, containing a reminder of the meeting and a summary of company's recent social media activity.

# Setup steps
The workflow requires you to have the following accounts set up in their respective nodes:
