## Description

**Automatically extract sales insights from call transcripts and update your CRM.**

  Every time Scoot finishes transcribing a sales call, this workflow pulls out the key details—budget, competitors, objections, next steps—and sends a formatted summary to the rep.

  ## How It Works

  1. Scoot webhook triggers when transcription completes
  2. Fetches the full transcript via Scoot API
  3. AI Agent (Gemini) extracts structured data: budget, competitors, objections, timeline, decision maker, pain points, buying signals
  4. Updates your CRM with extracted fields
  5. Emails a formatted summary to the sales rep

  If the transcript is still processing, it retries automatically (up to 6 times, 1 hour apart).

  ## Setup

  1. **Import** the workflow JSON
  2. **Add credentials:**
     - Scoot API → Header Auth with your API key
     - Google Gemini → API key from [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com)
     - Gmail → OAuth2
  3. **Copy webhook URL** to Scoot Dashboard → Webhooks → Transcription Complete
  4. **Replace the mock CRM node** with HubSpot, Salesforce, or Pipedrive
  5. **Test** with the manual trigger (uses sample data)
  6. **Activate**
