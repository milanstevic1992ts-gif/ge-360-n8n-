## Description

# Zoho CRM - Conversation Intelligence Analyzer

This workflow automatically processes customer call recordings, transcribes them using OpenAI Whisper, extracts key topics, identifies commitments, analyzes sentiment, generates follow-up suggestions and updates the corresponding Zoho CRM Lead — all without manual efforts.

It eliminates the need for listening to calls or writing summaries and equips your sales team with instant AI-generated insights.

## ⚡ Quick Start (Fast Setup)

- Import the workflow JSON into n8n.
- Add Zoho CRM OAuth2 & OpenAI API credentials.
- Copy the webhook URL and configure your telephony system to POST call recordings.
- Map Zoho custom fields.
- Upload a test recording → Confirm CRM updates → Activate workflow.


## 📘 What It Does

This workflow turns every incoming call recording into structured insights which your sales & customer support team can immediately use. When a recording is received, the call is automatically transcribed using OpenAI’s Whisper model. That transcript is then processed by multiple AI nodes that detect topics, customer sentiment, commitments and possible follow-up actions.

All extracted data — such as mood, sentiment score, subjects, action items and commitments is merged into a clean result object and pushed to the matching Lead in Zoho CRM. The sales team gets ready-to-use call intelligence instantly, improving decision-making, accuracy and speed.

This automation works 24/7 and replaces hours of manual review work with reliable AI-generated summaries.


## 👤 Who’s It For

- Sales & Customer support teams using Zoho CRM.
- Support teams handling inbound/outbound calls.
- Businesses wanting call analytics without manual transcription.
- Zoho CRM admins who want automation with minimal maintenance.
- Organizations using telephony/VoIP systems that support call exports.


## 🧾 Requirements

To use this workflow, you need:

- An n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- Zoho CRM OAuth2 credentials
- OpenAI API key (Whisper + GPT models)
- A telephony system capable of POSTing audio files to a webhook
- Zoho fields to store: 
	- Topics
	- Main subject
	- Action items 
	- Sentiment 
	- Mood 
	- Follow-up text 
	- Commitments (optional)


## ⚙️ How It Works & How to Set Up

### 1. Webhook Trigger

Your call system sends an audio file (.mp3, .wav, etc.) to the webhook. The workflow starts instantly—no polling required.

### 2. Workflow Configuration

Static values like:
- `sentimentThreshold = 0.7`
- `minCommitmentConfidence = 0.8` 
ensure consistent logic across nodes.

### 3. Audio Transcription (OpenAI Whisper)

The audio file is converted to text. This transcript becomes the base for all analysis nodes.

### 4. Key Topic Extraction

AI identifies:
- Key topics 
- Main subject 
- Important action items 

### 5. Sentiment & Mood Analysis

AI analyzes:
- Customer mood 
- Sales rep tone 
- Overall sentiment 
- Sentiment score 

### 6. Commitment Extraction

AI detects commitments using a structured JSON schema.

### 7. Follow-up Generation

GPT generates 3–5 follow-up suggestions based on the transcript & commitments.

### 8. Combine All Insights

A Set node merges transcription, topics, sentiment, commitments and follow-up text.

### 9. Update Zoho CRM Lead

Updates Zoho custom fields so the sales team gets immediate insights.
