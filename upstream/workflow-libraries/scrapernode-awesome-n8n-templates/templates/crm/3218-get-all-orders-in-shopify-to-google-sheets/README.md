> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

This workflow retrieves all Shopify Orders and saves them into a Google Sheets spreadsheet using the [Shopify Admin REST API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/2025-01/resources/order#get-orders?status=any). It uses [pagination](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/usage/pagination) to ensure all orders are collected efficiently.

I originally built this workflow for my own use and found it valuable for understanding how Shopify pagination works. Now, I’m sharing it to help others automate their order retrieval process.

## How It Works
Instead of relying on the built-in Shopify node (**Get Orders Many**), this workflow leverages the HTTP Request node to fetch paginated chunks manually.

- Shopify uses cursor-based pagination (**page_info**) instead of traditional page numbers.
- Pagination data is stored in the response headers, so we need to enable `Include Response Headers and Status` in the HTTP Request node.
- You can modify the limit parameter to control batch sizes and optimize for rate limits.
- This workflow can be run on demand or scheduled to keep your data up to date.

## Parameters
You can adjust these parameters in the HTTP Request node:

- limit – The number of orders per request (default: 50, max: 250).
- fields – Comma-separated list of fields to retrieve.
- page_info – Used for pagination; only limit and fields are allowed when paginating.

📌 Note: when you query the paginated chunks with `page_info`, only the limit and fields parameters are allowed

## Credentials
- Shopify API Key – Required for authentication.
- Google Sheets API credentials – Needed to insert data into the spreadsheet.

## Who Is This For?
- Shopify store owners who need to export all orders to Google Sheets.
- Users who want full control over API parameters for optimized queries.
- Anyone looking for a flexible and scalable Shopify data extraction solution.
