## Description

**Who is this for?**
Agencies, consultants, and service providers who conduct discovery calls and need to quickly turn conversations into professional proposals.

**What it does:**
This workflow transforms meeting transcripts into complete, professional quotes using a sophisticated multi-agent AI architecture. It handles the entire quote lifecycle: from transcript analysis to client signature and onboarding.

**How it works:**
1. **Trigger**: Google Drive detects a new VTT/transcript file in a designated folder
2. **Extraction**: The transcript is cleaned and parsed, then matched with calendar data to identify the client
3. **AI Analysis**: A main orchestrator agent analyzes the call and delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents:
   - **SOW Agent**: Generates problems, solutions, and action items
   - **Pricing Agent**: Creates competitive pricing based on service catalog and market research
4. **Document Creation**: PandaDoc API creates the quote with all tokens populated
5. **Review & Approval**: Quote is sent to Slack for human review with approve/reject buttons
6. **Delivery**: Approved quotes are sent via Gmail with custom HTML templates
7. **Post-Signature**: Webhook triggers CRM update and welcome email upon signature

**Key Features:**
- Multi-agent architecture with specialized AI agents
- Automatic pricing calculation with 80%+ margin targeting
- Market research integration via Perplexity API
- Human-in-the-loop approval via Slack
- Professional HTML email templates
- CRM integration (Notion) for client status tracking
