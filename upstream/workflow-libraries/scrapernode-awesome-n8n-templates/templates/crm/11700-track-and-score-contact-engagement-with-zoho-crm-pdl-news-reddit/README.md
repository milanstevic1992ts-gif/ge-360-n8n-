> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Since TikTok doesn't have a public API, getting data usually means fragile HTTP scraping. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok) is a community node that gives you clean JSON for [TikTok profiles](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/profiles), [videos](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/posts), and [comments](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok/scrapers/comments) — drop it into your workflow and skip the parsing.

## Description

# Zoho CRM – Social Media Engagement Tracker  

This workflow automatically monitors new or updated Contacts in Zoho CRM, enriches them using People Data Labs, checks public visibility across News + Reddit, calculates an engagement score and updates Zoho CRM fields accordingly. When a Contact shows high online engagement, the workflow automatically opens a Deal and logs a note to help sales teams act quickly.


### 🚀 Quick Implementation

1. Import this workflow JSON into n8n.
2. Add Zoho OAuth2 credentials & set webhook URL.
3. Add People Data Labs API Key & GNews API Key.
4. Ensure CRM custom fields exist-`Social_Profiles`,`Engagement_Score`,`Mentions_Counts`,`Social_Status`
5. Update a Contact in Zoho → watch automation fire!


## 🔍 What It Does
This automation transforms a simple Zoho CRM instance into a proactive intelligence system that detects which contacts are gaining public attention online. When a Contact is created or updated in Zoho CRM, n8n automatically retrieves verified profile data such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and GitHub using People Data Labs — eliminating manual research and spreadsheet maintenance.

Next, the workflow checks whether the contact is appearing in global News platforms (via GNews) or being discussed on Reddit. It analyzes the volume and context of these public mentions to estimate how relevant, visible or influential the person may be online. Each discovered activity contributes to a calculated Engagement Score.

That score and all enrichment details are written back to Zoho CRM, helping sales and marketing teams instantly identify high-potential contacts. When the score exceeds a defined threshold, the workflow even creates a Deal automatically — meaning your CRM will notify your team of hot prospects before someone else reaches them. This safeguards missed opportunities, speeds outreach and improves your entire pipeline efficiency.
