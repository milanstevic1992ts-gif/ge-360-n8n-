## Description

## Summary

Automatically sync your Beex leads to HubSpot by handling both creation and update events in real time.

## How It Works

1. **Trigger Activation:** The workflow is triggered when a lead is created or updated in Beex.

2. **Data Transformation:** The nested data structure from the Beex Trigger is flattened into a simple JSON format for easier processing.

3. **Email Validation:** The workflow verifies that the lead contains a valid email address (non-null), as this field serves as the unique identifier in HubSpot.

4. **Field Mapping:** Configure the fields (via drag and drop) that will be used to create or update a contact in HubSpot.

⚠️ **Important:** Field names must exactly match the contact property names defined in HubSpot.

5. **Event Routing:** The workflow routes the action based on the event type received: `contact_create` or `contact_update`.

6. **Branch Selection:** If the event is `contact_create`, the workflow follows the upper branch; otherwise, it continues through the lower branch.

7. **API Request Execution:** The corresponding HTTP request is executed POST to create a new contact or PUT to update an existing one both using the same JSON body structure.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Beex Nodes:** Before importing the template, install the Beex trigger and node using the following package name:
```
n8n-nodes-beex
```

2. **Configure HubSpot Credentials:** Set up your HubSpot credentials with:
   - Access Token (typically from a private app)
   - Read/Write permissions for **Contacts** objects

3. **Configure Beex Credentials:** For Beex users with platform access (for trial requests, contact frank@beexcc.com):
   - Navigate to **Platform Settings** → **API Key & Callback**
   - Copy your API key and paste it into the Beex Trigger node in n8n

4. **Set Up Webhook URL:** Copy the Webhook URL (Test/Production) from the Beex Trigger Node and paste it into the Callback Integration section in Beex. Save your changes.

## Requirements

- **HubSpot:** An account with a Private App Token and Read/Write permissions for **Contacts** objects.
- **Beex:** An account with lead generation permissions and a Bearer Token configured in the Trigger Node.
- **Event Configuration:** In the Beex platform's **API Key & Callback** section, enable the following events:
  - "Update general and custom contact data"
  - "Networking"

## Customization Options

- **Contact Filtering:** Add filters to control which Beex leads should sync to HubSpot.
- **Identifier Configuration:** By default, only leads with a valid email address are processed to ensure accurate matching in HubSpot CRM. You can modify this logic to apply additional restrictions.
- **Field Mapping:** The "Set Fields Update" node is the primary customization point. Here you can map Beex fields to HubSpot properties for both creation and update operations (see Step 4 in How It Works).
- **Field Compatibility:** Ensure that Beex custom fields are compatible with HubSpot's default or custom properties; otherwise, API calls will fail due to schema mismatches.
