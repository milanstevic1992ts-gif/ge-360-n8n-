## 📦 Use Case  
### Example Product: [AI-Powered Social Media Content Generator & Publisher](https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/8CG259Q744FT4)   
When a customer buys this product through [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/8CG259Q744FT4), this automation:  

- Listens for a successful payment event  
- Fetches order details via API  
- Sends an HTML email with the template attached

---

- A PayPal developer account  
- PayPal OAuth2 credentials configured in n8n

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Setup  

### 1. Webhook Trigger  
**Node:** Webhook  
Listens for a POST request from PayPal’s webhook for `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED` events.  
📌 Add the webhook to your PayPal Developer App &gt; Webhooks.

### 2. Wait  
**Node:** Wait  
Adds a brief delay to ensure the payment is completely processed before continuing.

### 3. Filter Event Type  
**Node:** Switch  
Processes only when the event is `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED`.

### 4. Fetch Order Details  
**Node:** HTTP Request  
Retrieves the order information from PayPal's Orders API.  
**URL format:**  
`https://api.paypal.com/v2/checkout/orders/{{ order_id }}`

### 5. Extract Email & Product Info  
**Node:** Set  
Extracts first name, last name, email address, and the purchased item name.

### 6. Identify Product Purchased  
**Node:** Switch  
Checks if the product is “AI-Powered Social Media Content Generator & Publisher”.

### 7. Download Workflow File  
**Node:** HTTP Request  
Fetches the hosted workflow JSON from object storage (Oracle in this case).

### 8. Convert to Downloadable File  
**Node:** Code  
Converts the JSON content into a binary file and attaches it.

### 9. Send Custom Email  
**Node:** Send Email  
Sends a rich HTML email to the buyer with:  
- Their name  
- The file attachment  
- Product name
