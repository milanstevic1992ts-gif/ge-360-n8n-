🧠 **AI Qualification Engine**  
An OpenAI-powered Agent evaluates the lead’s industry, region, and needs to generate a persona summary and routing rationale.  

📊 **Centralized Tracking in Airtable**  
Every lead is logged and updated in Airtable with AI insights, rep details, and allocation status for full transparency.
