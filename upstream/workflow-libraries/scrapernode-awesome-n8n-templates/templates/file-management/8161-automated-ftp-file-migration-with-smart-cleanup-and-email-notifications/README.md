# Automated FTP File Migration with Smart Cleanup and Email Notifications

## Overview
This n8n workflow automates the secure transfer of files between FTP servers on a scheduled basis, providing enterprise-grade reliability with comprehensive error handling and dual notification systems (email + webhook). Perfect for data migrations, automated backups, and multi-server file synchronization.

## What it does
This workflow automatically discovers, filters, transfers, and safely removes files between FTP servers while maintaining complete audit trails and sending detailed notifications about every operation.

**Key Features:**
- **Scheduled Execution**: Configurable timing (daily, hourly, weekly, or custom cron expressions)
- **Smart File Filtering**: Regex-based filtering by file type, size, date, or name patterns  
- **Safe Transfer Protocol**: Downloads → Uploads → Validates → Cleans up source
- **Dual Notifications**: Email alerts + webhook integration for both success and errors
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed audit trail of all operations with timestamps
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff for network issues
- **Production Ready**: Built-in safety measures and extensive documentation

## Use Cases

### 🏢 Enterprise & IT Operations
- **Data Center Migration**: Moving files between different hosting environments
- **Backup Automation**: Scheduled transfers to secondary storage locations  
- **Multi-Site Synchronization**: Keeping files in sync across geographic locations
- **Legacy System Integration**: Bridging old and new systems through automated transfers

### 📊 Business Operations  
- **Document Management**: Automated transfer of contracts, reports, and business documents
- **Media Asset Distribution**: Moving images, videos, and marketing materials between systems
- **Data Pipeline**: Part of larger ETL processes for business intelligence
- **Compliance Archiving**: Moving files to compliance-approved storage systems

### 🔧 Development & DevOps
- **Build Artifact Distribution**: Deploying compiled applications across environments  
- **Configuration Management**: Synchronizing config files between servers
- **Log File Aggregation**: Collecting logs from multiple servers for analysis
- **Automated Deployment**: Moving release packages to production servers

## How it works

### 📋 Workflow Steps
1. **Schedule Trigger** → Initiates workflow at specified intervals
2. **File Discovery** → Lists files from source FTP server with optional recursion
3. **Smart Filtering** → Applies customizable filters (type, size, date, name patterns)
4. **Secure Download** → Retrieves files to temporary n8n storage with retry logic
5. **Safe Upload** → Transfers files to destination with directory auto-creation
6. **Transfer Validation** → Verifies successful upload before proceeding
7. **Source Cleanup** → Removes original files only after confirmed success
8. **Comprehensive Logging** → Records all operations with detailed metadata
9. **Dual Notifications** → Sends email + webhook notifications for success/failure

### 🔄 Error Handling Flow
- **Network Issues** → Automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- **Authentication Problems** → Immediate email alert with troubleshooting steps  
- **Permission Errors** → Detailed logging with recommended actions
- **Disk Space Issues** → Safe failure with source file preservation
- **File Corruption** → Integrity validation with rollback capability

## Setup Requirements

### 🔑 Credentials Needed
1. **Source FTP Server**
   - Host, port, username, password
   - Read permissions required
   - SFTP recommended for security

2. **Destination FTP Server**  
   - Host, port, username, password
   - Write permissions required
   - Directory creation permissions

3. **SMTP Email Server**
   - SMTP host and port (e.g., smtp.gmail.com:587)
   - Authentication credentials
   - For success and error notifications

4. **Monitoring API** (Optional)
   - Webhook URL for system integration
   - Authentication tokens if required

### ⚙️ Configuration Steps
1. **Import Workflow** → Load the JSON template into your n8n instance
2. **Configure Credentials** → Set up all required FTP and SMTP connections
3. **Customize Schedule** → Adjust cron expression for your timing needs
4. **Set File Filters** → Configure regex patterns for your file types
5. **Configure Paths** → Set source and destination directory structures
6. **Test Thoroughly** → Run with test files before production deployment
7. **Enable Monitoring** → Activate email notifications and logging

## Customization Options

### 📅 Scheduling Examples
```cron
0 2 * * *     # Daily at 2 AM
0 */6 * * *   # Every 6 hours  
0 8 * * 1-5   # Weekdays at 8 AM
0 0 1 * *     # Monthly on 1st
*/15 * * * *  # Every 15 minutes
```

### 🔍 File Filter Patterns
```regex
# Documents
\\.(pdf|doc|docx|xls|xlsx)$

# Images  
\\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|svg)$

# Data Files
\\.(csv|json|xml|sql)$

# Archives
\\.(zip|rar|7z|tar|gz)$

# Size-based (add as condition)
{{ $json.size &gt; 1048576 }}  # Files &gt; 1MB

# Date-based (recent files only)
{{ $json.date &gt; $now.minus({days: 7}) }}
```

### 📁 Directory Organization
```javascript
// Date-based structure
/files/{{ $now.format('YYYY/MM/DD') }}/

// Type-based structure  
/files/{{ $json.name.split('.').pop() }}/

// User-based structure
/users/{{ $json.owner || 'system' }}/

// Hybrid approach
/{{ $now.format('YYYY-MM') }}/{{ $json.type }}/
```
