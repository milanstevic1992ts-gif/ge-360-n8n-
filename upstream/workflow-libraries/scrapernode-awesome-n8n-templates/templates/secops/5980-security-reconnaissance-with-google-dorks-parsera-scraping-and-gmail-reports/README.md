> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*

## How it Works:
1. - Accepts a domain from a web form
2. - Generates a list of Google dorks targeting that domain
3. - Scrapes Google search results for each dork 
4. - Filters out junk links (Google internal, non-http)
5. - Formats valid results as a markdown report
6. - Emails the report to your inbox

## For this workflow you will need to configure credentials in n8n as well as create a Parsera.io agent:

### 1. AI Scraper Account
- Create an account for: https://app.parsera.io
- Create an agent named "Google" and use the URL https://google.com
- Copy/Paste your Parsera.io API key to the 'Scrape with agent' node in the n8n workflow

### 2. Gmail OAuth2
- Go to Google Cloud Console
- Enable Gmail API
- Create OAuth2 credentials
- Copy/Paste the Gmail API key to the Gmail node in the n8n workflow
