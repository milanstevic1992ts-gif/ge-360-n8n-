# 🔍 Write personalized cold emails from LinkedIn leads with Wiza

> ⚡ **85 views** · 🔍 [AI RAG & Knowledge Retrieval](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you're pulling LinkedIn data through HTTP requests or dealing with API restrictions, there's a community node called [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin) that handles this natively. It has dedicated scrapers for [profiles](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/profiles), [companies](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/companies), [jobs](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/jobs), and [people search](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin/scrapers/people-search) — you just pass a URL and get structured data back.

Submit a LinkedIn profile URL through a form. The workflow finds their email and company info using Wiza, then researches the prospect and their company with Perplexity AI to uncover recent news, growth signals, and pain points.
