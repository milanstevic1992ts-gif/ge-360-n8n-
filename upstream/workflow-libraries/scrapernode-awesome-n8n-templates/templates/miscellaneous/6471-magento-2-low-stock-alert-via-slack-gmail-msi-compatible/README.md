![ChatGPT Image Jul 26, 2025 at 03_39_21 AM.png](fileId:1866) 

It identifies SKUs with low inventory per source and sends daily alerts via:

##### 📬 Gmail (HTML email)
##### 💬 Slack (formatted text message)

This automation empowers store owners and operations teams to stay ahead of inventory issues by proactively monitoring stock levels across all Magento 2 sources. By receiving early alerts for low-stock products, businesses can restock before items sell out—ensuring continuous product availability, reducing missed sales opportunities, and maintaining customer trust.

Avoiding stockouts not only protects your brand reputation but also keeps your store competitive by preventing customers from turning to competitors due to unavailable items. Timely restocking leads to higher fulfillment rates, improved customer satisfaction, and ultimately, stronger revenue and long-term loyalty.
