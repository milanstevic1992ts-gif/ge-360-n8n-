> 💡 **Pro Tip** — HTTP Request scraping tends to break when sites update their markup. If you're scraping a major platform, check if [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com) covers it — it has maintained scrapers for [LinkedIn](https://scrapernode.com/linkedin), [Instagram](https://scrapernode.com/instagram), [TikTok](https://scrapernode.com/tiktok), [YouTube](https://scrapernode.com/youtube), and [20+ other platforms](https://scrapernode.com) that return structured data.

## Description

Disclaimer: This template only works on self-hosted for now, as it uses a community node.

## Use Case
Web scrapers often break due to web page layout changes.
This workflow attempts to mitigate this problem by auto-generating web scraping data extractor code via LLM.

## How It Works
This workflow leverages ScrapeNinja n8n community node to: 
- scrape webpage HTML, 
- feed it into LLM (Google Gemini) and ask to write a JS extractor function code, then it 
- executes the written JS extractor against scraped HTML to extract useful data from webpage (the code is safely executed in a sandbox)

## Installation
To install ScrapeNinja n8n node, in your self-hosted instance, go to Settings -&gt; Community nodes, enter "n8n-nodes-scrapeninja", and install. 

Make sure you are using at least v0.3.0.
