# ⚒️ Review GitHub pull requests with AI and log results to PostgreSQL and Slack

> ⚡ **34 views** · ⚒️ [Engineering](../)

> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you need GitHub data beyond what the REST API gives you, [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/github) has a [repository scraper](https://scrapernode.com/github/scrapers/repositories) that extracts metadata at scale without token rate limits.

## Description

Automatically detects new GitHub Pull Requests, analyzes changed code with AI, generates detailed review comments (quality, security, performance, best practices), posts suggestions back to the PR, stores results in a database, and sends notifications.

## Good to Know
- Triggers automatically on new/updated **GitHub Pull Requests** via webhook (or manual test)
- Fetches only **changed files/diffs** — no need to clone full repo
- Uses **AI** (Grok, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.) to provide intelligent, context-aware feedback
- Covers multiple dimensions: code quality, bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, maintainability, style/best practices
- Posts **formatted review comments** directly on the GitHub PR (with severity levels, suggestions, code snippets)
- Stores review history & scores in **PostgreSQL** (or other DB) for auditing, metrics, team dashboards
- Sends **real-time notifications** (Slack, Discord, email, etc.) for high-severity findings
- Saves developers hours on initial reviews and catches issues early

## How It Works

### 1. Trigger PR Detection
- **GitHub Webhook** node — listens for `pull_request` events (opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review)
- Optional: **Filter** node to ignore drafts, dependabot PRs, or specific branches
- Manual trigger available for testing

### 2. Fetch & Analyze Code
- **GitHub** node — retrieves PR details (title, body, number, repo, base/head commits)
- **GitHub** or **HTTP Request** — fetches list of changed files + diffs (using GitHub API `/pulls/{number}/files` and diff content)
- **Merge PR Details & Extract Diffs** — combines metadata + code changes into structured format
- Prepares payload: file paths, diff hunks, full file content if needed (truncated for large files)

### 3. AI Review & Score
- Sends prepared diff data + context (language, repo conventions, custom guidelines) to **AI model**
- Prompt engineering focuses on:
  - Code correctness & bugs
  - Security vulnerabilities (OWASP, secrets, injection risks)
  - Performance optimizations
  - Readability, maintainability, SOLID principles
  - Best practices & style (specific to language/framework)
  - Refactoring suggestions with examples
- AI returns structured output: severity (low/medium/high/critical), category, comment text, suggested fix (with code block)
- Optional: **Score** node — assigns overall PR quality score (0–100) based on findings

### 4. Post Review & Notify
- **Route** by severity / issue count (e.g. critical → immediate Slack)
- **GitHub** node — posts detailed review comments on the PR (as bot user)
  - Supports threaded replies, line-specific comments (if hunk positions available)
  - Adds label e.g. `ai-reviewed`, `needs-changes`
- **Store Results in PostgreSQL** — logs full review (PR link, timestamp, AI output JSON, score, issues list)
- **Send Summary to Slack** (or Discord/Email/Telegram) — concise message with key findings, link to PR, severity highlights
- **Log Completion** — records successful execution for monitoring

## Data Sources
- **GitHub** — Pull Requests, diffs, comments, labels (via webhook + API)
- **AI Model** — Grok (xAI), OpenAI GPT-4o / o1, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, or local LLM
- **Storage** — PostgreSQL (recommended for structured querying), or Supabase, Airtable, Google Sheets
- **Notifications** — Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, Email (SMTP), Telegram

## How to Use
1. **Import** the workflow JSON into your n8n instance
2. **Configure credentials**:
   - GitHub OAuth / Personal Access Token (with `repo` scope)
   - AI provider API key (Grok/OpenAI/etc.)
   - PostgreSQL database connection
   - Slack/Discord/Email credentials
3. **Set up GitHub Webhook**:
   - In repo Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook
   - Payload URL = your n8n webhook URL
   - Content type: application/json
   - Events: Pull requests
4. **Customize AI prompt** — add repo-specific rules, coding standards, ignored patterns
5. **Tune filters** — minimum severity to post, files to skip (e.g. lock files, generated code)
6. **Test** — create/open a small PR or use Execute Workflow with sample payload
7. **Activate** — turn on the workflow and monitor Executions + Logs

## Requirements
- n8n (self-hosted preferred for webhooks)
- GitHub repo with admin access to add webhook & bot token
- AI API access with sufficient token limit (large PRs = large prompts)
- PostgreSQL database (or alternative) for persistent storage
- Notification service account (Slack app, Discord bot, etc.)

## Customizing This Workflow
- **Add custom best practices** — load from Google Sheets/Notion/Airtable and inject into prompt
- **Support multi-file analysis** — chunk very large PRs or summarize per-file first
- **Auto-approve low-risk PRs** — add approval action if score &gt; 90 and no critical issues
- **Security focus** — integrate with tools like Semgrep/Trivy results
- **Comment on specific lines** — use GitHub API position/hunk data for inline comments
- **Team routing** — notify language-specific experts via Slack channels
- **Metrics dashboard** — connect DB to Grafana/Metabase for review trends
- **Ignore patterns** — skip vendor/, node_modules/, tests/, etc.
- **Multiple AI models** — fallback or ensemble (e.g. Claude for reasoning + Grok for speed)
