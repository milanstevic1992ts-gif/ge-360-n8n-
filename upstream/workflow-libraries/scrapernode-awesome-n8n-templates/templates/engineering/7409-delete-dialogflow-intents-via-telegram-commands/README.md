## Description

## Delete a Dialogflow Intent via Telegram 🗑️

This workflow allows you to delete a specific Dialogflow intent simply by sending the keyword `delete` through Telegram. It’s designed for quick and safe deletions from your mobile device, without needing to access the Dialogflow console.

---

### 🔧 What does this workflow do?

1. **Listens for Telegram messages** using the `Telegram Trigger` node.
2. **Validates the user ID** through the `User validation by ID` node, ensuring only authorized users can trigger the deletion.
3. **Checks if the message equals `delete`** using the `Keyword validation` node.
4. If both checks pass:
   - Performs an HTTP GET request via `HTTP Request GET NAME` to **retrieve the name of the intent** (used in the confirmation message).
   - Adds a small delay using `simulated delay`.
   - Then executes a DELETE request to the Dialogflow API via the `HTTP Request ELIMINAR` node to **delete the intent**.
   - Sends a Telegram confirmation message through the `Confirmation message` node.
5. If the user ID or keyword is invalid:
   - Responds with a custom message using either `Invalid user message` or `Invalid keyword message`.

### 📌 Requirements
