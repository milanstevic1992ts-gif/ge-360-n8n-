> 💡 **Pro Tip** — Twitter's API is paid now, which makes simple data pulls expensive. [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/twitter) is a community node that scrapes [Twitter profiles](https://scrapernode.com/twitter/scrapers/profiles) and [posts](https://scrapernode.com/twitter/scrapers/posts) without needing API access.

## Description

This workflow handles the incoming call from Twitter and sends the required response for verification.

On registering the webhook with the Twitter Account Activity API, Twitter expects a signature in response. Twitter also randomly ping the webhook to ensure it is active and secure.
