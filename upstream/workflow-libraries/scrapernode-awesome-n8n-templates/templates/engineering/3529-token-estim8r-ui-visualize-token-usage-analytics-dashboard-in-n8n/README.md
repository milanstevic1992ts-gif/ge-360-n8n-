Token Estim8r UI is the premium version of our token tracking solution for n8n users who want real-time insight into AI model usage and exact cost per execution — all in a beautifully designed analytics dashboard.

We've done the work with **over 4000 lines of code** for you to simply add a pre-configured **HTTP Request node** to the end of any workflow you want to track, and Token Estim8r UI will handle the rest: collecting data, analyzing token usage, calculating model costs, and **feeding everything into a clean UI with charts, graphs, and summaries**.

### 🖼️ What the Dashboard Looks Like

---

### 🙋‍♂️ Who is this for?
This workflow is perfect for:
- AI engineers
- Automation specialists
- Business analysts
- Teams using OpenAI, Anthropic, Claude, or any token-based LLM

If you’re managing API budgets or optimizing prompt performance, this tool provides immediate visibility into where tokens (and money) are going.

---

### 😌 What problem does this solve?
n8n makes it easy to build powerful workflows — but it doesn’t natively track OpenAI token usage or cost. Without that visibility, it’s impossible to:
- Know what each automation is costing
- Spot inefficiencies in prompt construction
- Track cost trends over time

**Token Estim8r UI solves that with zero manual logging.**

---

### ⚙️ What this workflow does
- Fetches detailed execution logs from n8n
- Extracts prompt/completion token usage per model/tool
- Optionally retrieves live pricing or use preset pricing as of 4/2025
- Calculates total cost per run
- Sends data to a backend for aggregation
-  Displays a full-featured analytics dashboard with:
    - Total tokens, cost, and usage trends
    - Most used models/tools
    - Workflow-model correlations
    - Cost breakdowns and comparisons
    - Workflow usage over time
    - **Auto-complete workflow search** with filtering by ID or name
    - **Filter by date or workflow** (single or all workflows)
    - Built in image server
    - **Sortable & searchable data table** of filtered results with:
        - Prompt & completion token breakdown
        - Cost calculations
        - Workflow name + direct link to the workflow
        - Link to exact execution in n8n

### 🛠️ How Setup Works
1. Import the Token Estim8r UI workflow into your n8n instance
2. Deploy the included dashboard (React/Next.js app, hosted or self-hosted)
3. Configure Google Sheets or your preferred backend (e.g., Supabase, Airtable)
4. Copy the prebuilt HTTP Request node into the end of any n8n workflow
5. Run your workflow — data is captured, aggregated and stored automatically in Google Sheets 🎉

---

### 🔄 What Makes This Better than the simple version?
The simple version logs to Google Sheets only. This premium UI version adds:
- Full analytics dashboard
- Cost aggregation across all workflows
- Graphs, filters, and model/tool comparisons

---

### 🔧 Customization Ideas
- Switch backend to Supabase or Firebase
- Add alerts via Slack when costs exceed thresholds
- Build weekly token cost summaries
- Track model performance across teams
- Add filters by user/session/timeframe
