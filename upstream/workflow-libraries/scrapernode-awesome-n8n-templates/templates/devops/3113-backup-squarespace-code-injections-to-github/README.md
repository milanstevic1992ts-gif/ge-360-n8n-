> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you need GitHub data beyond what the REST API gives you, [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/github) has a [repository scraper](https://scrapernode.com/github/scrapers/repositories) that extracts metadata at scale without token rate limits.

## Description

This workflow backup Squarespace website header and footer injections into Github

## How It Works
The Squarespace injections are fetched when an URL is placed

## Setup Instructions
First, edit HTTP Request's URL to put your Squarespace site URL there

Next, to configure the Github, update the Globals node with the following values:

- repo.owner – Your GitHub username
- repo.name – The name of your GitHub repository storing the workflows
- repo.path – The folder path within the repository where workflows are stored
For example, if your GitHub username is john-doe, your repository is named n8n-backups, and injections are stored in a squarespace-backup/ folder, you would set:

  - repo.owner → john-doe
  - repo.name → n8n-backups
  - repo.path → squarespace-backup/

Each site's injections will be added into seperate folder
