> 💡 **Pro Tip** — If you need GitHub data beyond what the REST API gives you, [ScraperNode](https://scrapernode.com/github) has a [repository scraper](https://scrapernode.com/github/scrapers/repositories) that extracts metadata at scale without token rate limits.

## Description

# n8n Workflows GitHub Manager

&gt; A comprehensive **n8n workflow** that provides complete bidirectional sync between your n8n instance and GitHub - automatically backs up all your workflows with intelligent change detection AND restores them when needed.

This workflow combines two powerful features in one:
* **Backup**: Automatically detects new, edited, renamed, and deleted workflows in your n8n instance, then syncs them to GitHub with smart commit messages and an index tracking system.
* **Restore**: Easily restore all workflows from your GitHub repository back to n8n - perfect for disaster recovery, new instance setup, or environment cloning.

## How It Works

### 🔄 Backup Mode (Automatic)

1. **Trigger**: Runs automatically every day at 7 PM UTC (or manually when triggered via the Schedule Trigger).
2. **Get/Create Index**: Attempts to fetch `index.json` from your GitHub repository.
   * **If found** → Downloads and parses it.
   * **If not found** → Creates a new empty index file and waits 3 seconds for GitHub to process.
3. **Fetch All Workflows**: Retrieves all workflows from your n8n instance via the n8n API.
4. **Smart Comparison**: The "C,E,D Checker" (Create, Edit, Delete) analyzes differences:
   * **CREATE** → New workflow not in index.
   * **RENAME** → Workflow name changed (deletes old file, creates new one).
   * **EDIT** → Existing workflow (flagged for content comparison).
   * **DELETE** → Workflow removed from n8n but still in GitHub.
   * **INDEX UPDATE** → Triggered if any changes detected.
5. **Route Actions**: Switch node routes each action to the appropriate branch:
   * **Create Branch** → Creates new workflow files in GitHub.
   * **Edit Branch** → Performs smart edit detection:
     * Fetches current file from GitHub.
     * Compares GitHub version vs. n8n version (normalized JSON).
     * **Only commits if content actually changed** (avoids timestamp-only updates).
   * **Delete Branch** → Removes workflow files from GitHub.
   * **Update Index Branch** → Updates `index.json` with latest mappings.
6. **Commit Messages**: Auto-generated with format: `[Workflow Name] (Action) YYYY-MM-DD`

### ⬇️ Restore Mode (Manual)

1. **Trigger**: Manually execute via the "When clicking 'Execute workflow'" manual trigger.
2. **Set GitHub Details**: Configure your repository owner and name.
3. **List Workflow Files**: Fetches all workflow JSON files from the `workflows/` folder in your GitHub repository.
   * **If folder not found** → Workflow stops gracefully (ensure backup ran at least once first).
4. **Loop Through Files**: Sequentially processes each workflow file:
   * Downloads the JSON content from GitHub.
   * Creates the workflow in your n8n instance via the n8n API.
5. **Sequential Processing**: Handles one workflow at a time to prevent conflicts and respect rate limits.
6. **Result**: All workflows from GitHub are restored to your n8n instance.

## Requirements

* **GitHub OAuth2 Credentials**:
  * Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) → OAuth Apps → New OAuth App.
  * Set **Authorization callback URL** to your n8n instance URL (e.g., `https://your-n8n.com/rest/oauth2-credential/callback`).
  * Copy **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
  * Add as OAuth2 credential in n8n (*Credentials → New → GitHub OAuth2*).

* **GitHub Repository**:
  * Create a new repository (public or private).
  * Note your **username** (repo owner) and **repository name**.

* **n8n API Credentials**:
  * In your n8n instance → *Settings → API* → Create new API key.
  * Add as n8n API credential in the workflow.

## How to Use

### Initial Setup

1. **Import the Workflow**:
   * Copy the provided JSON file.
   * In your n8n instance → click **Import Workflow** → paste or upload the JSON.

2. **Create GitHub Repository**:
   * Go to GitHub → Create a new repository (e.g., `n8n-workflows-manager`).
   * Leave it empty (no README, no .gitignore).

3. **Set Up GitHub OAuth2**:
   * In n8n → *Credentials → New → GitHub OAuth2*.
   * Fill in:
     * **Client ID** → from GitHub OAuth App.
     * **Client Secret** → from GitHub OAuth App.
   * Click **Connect my account** and authorize.

4. **Set Up n8n API Credentials**:
   * In n8n → *Settings → API* → Create new API key.
   * Copy the key.
   * In workflow → *Credentials → New → n8n API* → paste the key.
   * Set **Base URL** to your n8n instance (e.g., `https://your-n8n.com`).

5. **Configure Repository Details**:
   * Find **both** "Set Github Data" nodes in the workflow (one for backup, one for restore).
   * Edit the assignments in each:
     * `repo_owner`: Replace `"your-github-username"` with your GitHub username.
     * `repo_name`: Replace `"your-github-repository-name"` with your repository name.

6. **Connect Credentials to Nodes**:
   * Open each **GitHub node** (there are 8 total):
     * **Backup section**: Create Index File, Get Download Url for Index File, Create New Files, Update Index File, Get Download Url for Github File, Delete Files, Edit Files
     * **Restore section**: List Workflow Files
   * Set **Credential for GitHub OAuth2** to the one you created.
   * Open the **n8n API nodes** (Get All Workflows, Create Workflow) → Set **Credential for n8n API** to the one you created.

### Using Backup Mode

7. **Test Backup**:
   * Click the **"Schedule Trigger"** node at the top of the workflow.
   * Click **"Test workflow"**.
   * Monitor execution → All nodes in the backup section should turn green.
   * Check your GitHub repository → Should see `index.json` and `workflows/` folder with your workflows.

8. **Activate for Auto Backup**:
   * Once tested successfully, toggle the workflow to **Active**.
   * It will now run automatically every day at 7 PM UTC.

### Using Restore Mode

9. **Test Restore** (only after you have backups in GitHub):
   * Click the **"When clicking 'Execute workflow'"** manual trigger node at the bottom.
   * Click **"Test workflow"**.
   * Monitor execution → All nodes in the restore section should turn green.
   * Check your n8n workflows list → All workflows from GitHub should now be present.

10. **When to Use Restore**:
    * Setting up a new n8n instance.
    * Recovering after data loss.
    * Cloning workflows to another environment.
    * Rolling back to a previous state (manually download older commits from GitHub first).

---

## Important Notes

* **Smart Edit Detection**: Uses normalized JSON comparison to avoid unnecessary commits when only timestamps change.
* **Credentials**: Credential IDs are included but not actual secrets. You must reconnect credentials after restore.
* **Restored Workflows**: Created as new workflows with new IDs in **inactive** state by default.
* **File Structure**: `index.json` tracks all workflows; `workflows/` folder contains individual workflow files.
* **Security**: Use a private repository if workflows contain sensitive data. Credential secrets are never backed up.

---

## Customization

* **Change Schedule**: Edit "Schedule Trigger" node → modify `triggerAtHour` (default: 19 = 7 PM UTC)
* **File Path**: Modify `filePath` in GitHub nodes to change storage location
* **Notifications**: Add email/notification nodes to get alerts on backup completion
* **Selective Restore**: Add IF nodes to filter which workflows to restore
* **Multiple Repos**: Duplicate workflow for separate prod/dev backups
