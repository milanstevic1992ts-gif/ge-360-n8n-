# ⚙️ Compare your n8n version with latest release using n8n API

> ⚡ **565 views** · ⚙️ [DevOps & CI/CD](../)

## Description

## 🧑‍💻 Description
This workflow automatically compares the **version of your n8n instance** with the **latest release available**.  

Keeping your n8n instance up-to-date is essential for **security patches, bug fixes, performance improvements, and access to new automation features**. By running this workflow, you’ll know right away if your instance is behind and whether it’s time to upgrade.  

After the comparison, the workflow clearly shows whether your instance is **up-to-date** or **outdated**, along with the version numbers for both. This makes it easy to plan updates and keep your automation environment secure and reliable.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions  

### 1️⃣ Set Up n8n API Credentials
1. In your **n8n instance** → go to **Admin Panel → API**  
2. Copy your **API Key**  
3. In **n8n → Credentials → New → n8n API**  
   - Paste the API Key  
   - Save it  
4. Attach this credential to the **n8n node** (`Set up your n8n credentials`)  

---

## ✅ How It Works
- **Get Most Recent n8n Version** → Fetches the latest release info from [docs.n8n.io](https://docs.n8n.io).  
- **Extract Version + Clean Value** → Parses the version string for accuracy.  
- **Get your n8n version** → Connects to your own n8n instance via API and retrieves the current version.  
- **Compare** → Evaluates the difference and tells you if your instance is **current** or needs an **update**.

## 🎛️ Customization Guidance
- **Notifications**: Add an Email or Slack node to automatically notify your team when a new n8n update is available.  
- **Scheduling**: Use a **Schedule Trigger** to run this workflow daily or weekly for ongoing monitoring.  
- **Conditional Actions**: Extend the workflow to log version mismatches into Google Sheets, or even trigger upgrade playbooks.  
- **Multi-Instance Tracking**: Duplicate the version-check step for multiple n8n environments (e.g., dev, staging, production).

## 💬 Example Output
- *“Your instance (v1.25.0) is up-to-date with the latest release (v1.25.0).”*  
- *“Your instance (v1.21.0) is behind the latest release (v1.25.0). Please update to get the latest bug fixes and features.”*
