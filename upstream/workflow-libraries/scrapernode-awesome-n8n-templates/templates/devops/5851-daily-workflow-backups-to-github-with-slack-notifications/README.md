## Description

### Who is this for?
This workflow is ideal for n8n self-hosted users, DevOps engineers, and automation developers who want to automatically back up their n8n workflows to GitHub on a regular basis.

### What problem is this workflow solving
Manually backing up n8n workflows can be time-consuming and prone to human error. This workflow automates the backup process, ensuring that all workflows are safely stored in a version-controlled GitHub repository every 24 hours.

### What this workflow does
This automation runs daily to back up all workflows from your n8n instance to a specified GitHub repository. Each workflow is saved as a .json file using its unique ID, organized into a folder path defined by repo_path. The workflow is designed to manage memory usage efficiently by recursively calling itself. Once the backup is complete, it optionally sends a Slack notification to confirm success.

### Setup
1. Configure the Config node in the subworkflow to set:
   - GitHub Repo Owner
   - GitHub Repo Name
   - Main folder path (repo_path)
2. Connect your GitHub and (optionally) Slack credentials.
3. Set the workflow to run on a daily cron schedule.
4. Test the workflow manually to confirm the GitHub integration works.
