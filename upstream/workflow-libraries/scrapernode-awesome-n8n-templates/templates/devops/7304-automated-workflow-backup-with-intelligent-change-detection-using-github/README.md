## Description

# Advanced n8n Workflow Sync with GitHub

A robust workflow to back up and synchronize your n8n workflows to a GitHub repository, with intelligent change detection and support for file renames.

## 🎯 Who's it for?

This workflow is for n8n administrators, developers, and power users who want a reliable, automated way to:

- Keep a version-controlled history of their workflows.
- Collaborate on workflows using GitHub's infrastructure.
- Prevent data loss and have a disaster recovery plan for their n8n instance.

## ✨ Key Features (What it does)

- **Intelligent Sync**: Backs up all your n8n workflows to a designated GitHub repository.
- **Human-Readable Filenames**: Saves workflows with filenames based on their actual names in n8n (e.g., `My Awesome Workflow.json`).
- **Reliable Matching**: Uses the unique n8n workflow ID to reliably track files, even if their names change.
- **Rename Detection**: If you rename a workflow in n8n, it intelligently deletes the old file and creates a new one in a single logical operation.
- **Efficient Commits**: Commits changes to GitHub only when there are actual modifications to a workflow's logic or structure. It performs a deep comparison, ignoring metadata changes.
- **Clear Commit History**: Generates clean, informative commit messages:
  - `create: workflowName`
  - `update: workflowName`
  - `rename: oldName - newName`

## ⚙️ How It Works (Simple Steps)

1. **Get n8n Workflows**: The workflow starts by fetching all your current workflows from n8n.
2. **Get GitHub Files**: At the same time, it lists all existing workflow files from your GitHub repository.
3. **Compare & Decide**: It then compares each n8n workflow with its GitHub counterpart. It checks if anything changed, if it was renamed, or if it's new.
4. **Take Action**:
    - If a workflow is **new**, it's created on GitHub.
    - If a workflow is **updated**, the file content is changed on GitHub.
    - If a workflow was **renamed**, the old file is deleted, and a new one is created.
    - If **nothing changed**, the workflow is skipped.
5. **Send Report**: Finally, it can send a summary report to Telegram about what happened.

## 🚀 How to Set Up

1. **Credentials**:
    - **GitHub**: Go to `Credentials` &gt; `New` and add your GitHub credentials. You'll need a token with `repo` permissions.
    - **n8n API**: In the same `Credentials` section, create `n8n API` credentials. You'll need your n8n instance's Base URL and an API key (you can create one in your n8n user settings).
    - **Telegram (Optional)**: If you want notifications, add your Telegram Bot credentials.

2. **Configure the Workflow**:
    - Open the `Configuration` node (the green one at the start).
    - Fill in the following values:
        - `repo.owner`: Your GitHub username or organization name.
        - `repo.name`: The name of the repository for backups.
        - `repo.path`: The folder inside the repository to store workflows (e.g., `workflows/`).
        - `report.tg.chatID` (Optional): Your Telegram chat ID for notifications. Set to `0` to disable.
        - `report.verbose`: Set to `true` to receive a report even if there were no changes.

3. **Connect Credentials**:
    - Select your newly created credentials in the following nodes:
        - `Get all workflows`: Select your n8n API credentials.
        - All GitHub nodes (e.g., `List files`, `Create new file`): Select your GitHub credentials.
        - `Send a message` (Telegram): Select your Telegram credentials.

4. **Set the Schedule**:
    - In the `Schedule Trigger` node, configure how often you want the backup to run (e.g., every hour, once a day).

5. **Activate the Workflow**:
    - Save the workflow and toggle it to "Active".

## 🔧 How to Customize

- **Change Report Destination**: The final part of the workflow sends a report to Telegram. You can easily replace the `Send a message` node with a node for Slack, Discord, or email to change where notifications go. The message is pre-formatted in the `Render summary` node.

## 💡 What's Next? (Future Updates)

This workflow is actively maintained! Here's a sneak peek at what's planned for future versions:

- **Automatic Archive Handling**: The next major update will introduce logic to automatically detect when a workflow is archived in n8n and move it to a dedicated `archived/` folder in your GitHub repository, keeping your main backup directory clean.
- **Performance Optimizations**: I'm exploring ways to reduce API traffic by intelligently checking for changes before fetching full workflow data.
