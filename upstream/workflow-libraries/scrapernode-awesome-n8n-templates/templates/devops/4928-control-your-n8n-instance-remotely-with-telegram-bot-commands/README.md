# Your n8n Command Center in a Telegram Chat

This workflow connects your n8n instance with a Telegram Bot, giving you remote control over key admin operations through simple chat commands.

## 📱 You can

- List your workflows (**workflows**)

- Execute a workflow (**execute** [name])

- Activate/deactivate workflows (**activate** [name], **deactivate** [name])

- Permanently delete archived workflows (**cleanup**)

- Create backups of all your workflows and credentials (**backup**)

This is especially useful for self-hosted instances when you want quick access to your automation environment from your mobile device.
