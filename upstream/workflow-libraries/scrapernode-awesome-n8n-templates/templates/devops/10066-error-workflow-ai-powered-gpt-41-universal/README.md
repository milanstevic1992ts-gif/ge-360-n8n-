## Description

# **AI-Powered n8n Error Debugger & Notifier**
*Automatically analyze any workflow failure with AI, get actionable solutions, and receive a detailed report directly in your inbox.*

Stop wasting time deciphering cryptic error messages and stack traces. This template turns your n8n instance into a self-diagnosing system. When any of your workflows fail, this error handler automatically triggers, sends the error data to an AI agent for a full analysis, and delivers a comprehensive, easy-to-read report to your email. It's like having a personal AI debugging assistant on call 24/7.

| **Services Used** | **Features** |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🤖 **OpenAI / LangChain** | Provides deep, AI-driven root cause analysis of errors. |
| 📧 **Gmail** | Delivers beautifully formatted and detailed HTML email notifications. |
| 🚨 **n8n Error Trigger** | Acts as a global catch-all for any workflow failure in your instance. |
| ✨ **Data Formatting** | Organizes raw error data and AI analysis for clear reporting. |

## How It Works ⚙️

1.  **🚨 A Workflow Fails**: When any workflow in your n8n instance encounters an error, this workflow is automatically triggered.
2.  **🧠 AI Analysis**: The **Error Trigger** node passes the complete error context (message, stack trace, failing node, etc.) to a **LangChain Agent**. The agent is prompted to perform a deep analysis, identifying the root cause, potential solutions, impact, and urgency.
3.  **✨ Format Data**: A **Set** node neatly organizes the original error details alongside the new, structured AI analysis into a single, clean data object.
4.  **📧 Send Detailed Report**: The **Gmail** node uses this formatted data to construct a rich HTML email, presenting the error details and the AI's full analysis in a clear, actionable format, and sends it to your specified address.

## 🛠️ How to Set Up

This workflow is designed to be set as your instance's default error handler.

1.  **🔑 Add Credentials**:
    *   Add your **OpenAI API key** to the `OpenAI Chat Model` node.
    *   Add your **Gmail OAuth2 credentials** to the `Send Gmail Notification` node.
2.  **✏️ Configure Email**: In the `Send Gmail Notification` node, change the **To** field from `your-email@example.com` to your own email address or a team distribution list.
3.  **⚙️ Set as Global Error Workflow**:
    *   In your n8n instance, go to **Settings &gt; Workflow Default Settings**.
    *   In the **Error Workflow** dropdown, select this workflow (`AI-Powered n8n Error Debugger & Notifier`).
    *   Save the changes.
4.  **▶️ Activate**: Save and activate the workflow. It will now run automatically whenever another workflow fails.

## 💡 Customization Ideas

*   **Multi-Channel Alerts**: Replace or add nodes to send notifications to **Slack**, **Discord**, or **Telegram** for more immediate team visibility.
*   **Create an Error Dashboard**: Add a **Google Sheets**, **Notion**, or **Baserow** node after the `Format Data` node to log every error, creating a historical dashboard for tracking recurring issues.
*   **Severity-Based Routing**: Add an **IF** node to check the "Urgency Level" from the AI analysis. Route "Critical" errors to a PagerDuty or Twilio node to alert an on-call developer.
*   **Try Different Models**: Swap the `OpenAI Chat Model` for an **Anthropic** or **Google Gemini** node to compare analysis quality.
