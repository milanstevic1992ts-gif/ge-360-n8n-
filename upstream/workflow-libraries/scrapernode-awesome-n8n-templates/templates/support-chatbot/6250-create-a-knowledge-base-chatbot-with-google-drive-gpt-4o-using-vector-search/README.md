## Description

# Template: Create an AI Knowledge Base Chatbot with Google Drive and OpenAI GPT (Venio/Salesbear)

## 📋 Template Overview

This comprehensive n8n workflow template creates an intelligent AI chatbot that automatically transforms your Google Drive documents into a searchable knowledge base. The chatbot uses OpenAI's GPT models to provide accurate, context-aware responses based exclusively on your uploaded documents, making it perfect for customer support, internal documentation, and knowledge management systems.

## 🎯 What This Template Does

### Automated Knowledge Processing
- **Real-time Document Monitoring**: Automatically detects when files are added or updated in your designated Google Drive folder
- **Intelligent Document Processing**: Converts PDFs, text files, and other documents into searchable vector embeddings
- **Smart Text Chunking**: Breaks down large documents into optimally-sized chunks for better AI comprehension
- **Vector Storage**: Creates a searchable knowledge base that the AI can query for relevant information

### AI-Powered Chat Interface
- **Webhook Integration**: Receives questions via HTTP requests from any external platform (Venio/Salesbear)
- **Contextual Responses**: Maintains conversation history for natural, flowing interactions
- **Source-Grounded Answers**: Provides responses based strictly on your document content, preventing hallucinations
- **Multi-platform Support**: Works with any chat platform that can send HTTP requests

## 🚀 Detailed Workflow Operation

### Phase 1: Knowledge Base Creation

1. **File Monitoring**: Two trigger nodes continuously monitor your Google Drive folder for new files or updates
2. **Document Discovery**: When changes are detected, the workflow searches for and identifies the modified files
3. **Content Extraction**: Downloads the actual file content from Google Drive
4. **Text Processing**: Uses LangChain's document loader to extract text from various file formats
5. **Intelligent Chunking**: Splits documents into overlapping chunks (configurable size) for optimal AI processing
6. **Vector Generation**: Creates embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model
7. **Storage**: Stores vectors in an in-memory vector store for instant retrieval

### Phase 2: Chat Interaction

1. **Question Reception**: Webhook receives user questions in JSON format
2. **Data Extraction**: Parses incoming data to extract chat content and session information
3. **AI Processing**: AI Agent analyzes the question and determines relevant context
4. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Searches the vector store for the most relevant document sections
5. **Response Generation**: OpenAI generates responses based on found content and conversation history
6. **Authentication**: Validates the request using token-based authentication
7. **Response Delivery**: Sends the answer back to the originating platform

## 📚 Usage Instructions After Setup

### Adding Documents to Your Knowledge Base

1. **Upload Files**: Simply drag and drop documents into your configured Google Drive folder
2. **Supported Formats**: PDFs, TXT, DOC, DOCX, and other text-based formats
3. **Automatic Processing**: The workflow will automatically detect and process new files within minutes
4. **Updates**: Modify existing files, and the knowledge base will automatically update

### Integrating with Your Chat Platform

**Webhook URL**: Use the generated webhook URL to send questions
```
POST https://your-n8n-domain/webhook/your-custom-path
Content-Type: application/json

{
"body": {
"Data": {
"ChatMessage": {
"Content": "What are your business hours?",
"RoomId": "user-123-session",
"Platform": "web",
"User": {
"CompanyId": "company-456"
}
}
}
}
}
```

**Response Format**: The chatbot returns structured responses that your platform can display

### Testing Your Chatbot

1. **Initial Test**: Send a simple question about content you know exists in your documents
2. **Context Testing**: Ask follow-up questions to test conversation memory
3. **Edge Cases**: Try questions about topics not in your documents to verify appropriate responses
4. **Performance**: Monitor response times and accuracy
