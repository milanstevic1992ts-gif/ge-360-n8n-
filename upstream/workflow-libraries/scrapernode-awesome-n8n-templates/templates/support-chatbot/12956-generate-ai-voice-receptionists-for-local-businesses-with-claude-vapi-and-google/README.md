## Description

## Generate AI voice receptionist agents for local businesses using VAPI

Automate the creation of personalized AI phone receptionists for local businesses by scraping Google Maps, analyzing websites, and deploying voice agents to VAPI.

- **Agencies** offering AI voice solutions to local businesses
- **Consultants** helping SMBs modernize their phone systems
- **Developers** building lead generation tools for voice AI services
- **Entrepreneurs** launching AI receptionist services at scale

## What this workflow does

This workflow automates the entire process of creating customized AI voice agents:

1. Collects business criteria through a form (city, keywords, quantity)
2. Scrapes Google Maps for matching local businesses using Apify
3. Fetches and analyzes each business website
4. Generates tailored voice agent prompts using Claude AI
5. Automatically provisions voice assistants via VAPI API
6. Logs all created agents to Google Sheets for tracking

The AI adapts prompts based on business type (salon, restaurant, dentist, spa) with appropriate tone, services, and booking workflows.

2. Add your Apify credentials to the scraping node
3. Configure Anthropic and OpenRouter API keys
4. Replace `YOUR_VAPI_API_KEY` in the HTTP Request node header
5. Connect your Google Sheets account
6. Create a Google Sheet with columns: Business Name, Category, Address, Phone, Agent ID, Agent URL
7. Update the Sheet URL in both Google Sheets nodes
8. Activate the workflow and submit the form
