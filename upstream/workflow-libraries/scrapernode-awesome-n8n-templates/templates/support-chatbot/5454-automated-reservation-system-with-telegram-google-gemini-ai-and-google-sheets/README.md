## Description

💡 What It Is

SmartReserve is a flexible, automated Telegram chatbot built in n8n that allows users to request and confirm reservations for any kind of resource—training sessions, equipment, appointments, event slots, or more. It connects with Google Sheets for live availability tracking and automatically sends confirmation emails to your users.



⚙️ How It Works





Telegram Chatbot Interface
Users interact with a friendly bot to submit their reservation request. The bot collects:





Date



Name



Email



Resource / Service



Start Time & End Time



Final confirmation
All in one seamless message.



Conflict-Free Booking System
The bot checks your existing reservation sheet to avoid time overlaps before confirming.



Google Sheets Integration
Two spreadsheets are used:





Resource Info: Define available services, resources, or assets.



Reservation Log: Store confirmed reservations in structured rows.



Confirmation via Email
Once a reservation is accepted, the bot sends a detailed confirmation email to the user.
