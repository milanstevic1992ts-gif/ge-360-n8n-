# Website AI Agent with Calendar Integration

**Categories:** AI Agents, Website Integration, Calendar Automation

This workflow creates a complete website AI agent that can be embedded on any website with just a few lines of code. The agent handles customer inquiries, provides business information, and automatically books meetings by checking calendar availability in real-time. Built for simplicity and business practicality, this system proves that effective AI agents don't need to be overcomplicated.

## **Benefits**

- **Universal Website Integration** - Works with WordPress, Webflow, Squarespace, custom sites, or any platform that accepts HTML
- **Intelligent Calendar Management** - Checks availability and books meetings automatically without double-booking
- **Business-Ready Conversations** - Trained with specific business context and maintains professional, helpful interactions
- **Real-Time Functionality** - All changes to the N8N workflow are immediately reflected on your live website
- **No Technical Complexity** - Simple architecture that prioritizes reliability and consistent outputs over flashy features
- **Customizable Branding** - Easy to modify appearance, messages, and behavior to match your brand

## **How It Works**

**Embedded Chat Interface:**
- Generates embeddable HTML code that creates a chat widget on any website
- Provides both hosted and embedded modes for different use cases
- Handles all communication between website visitors and the AI system

**Intelligent Conversation Management:**
- Uses sophisticated system prompts to maintain context about your business
- Handles common inquiries about services, pricing, and company information
- Gracefully redirects off-topic conversations back to business matters

**Smart Calendar Integration:**
- Connects to Google Calendar to check real-time availability
- Automatically suggests meeting times based on your schedule
- Collects all necessary information (name, email, preferred time) before booking

**Meeting Booking Process:**
- Validates meeting requests against existing calendar entries
- Confirms all details with users before creating calendar events
- Sends automatic invitations with proper timezone handling

## **Required Setup Configuration**

**System Message Requirements:**
Your AI agent needs a comprehensive system message that includes:

- **Business Identity:** Company name, services, location, timezone
- **Business Context:** What you offer, pricing information, key differentiators
- **Conversation Rules:** How to handle inquiries, booking procedures, moderation guidelines
- **Personality Instructions:** Tone of voice, response style, conversation length preferences

**Example System Message Structure:**

You are a helpful, intelligent website chatbot for [Company Name], a [business type].
The current date is [dynamic date]. You are in the [timezone] timezone.

Business Context:

- We offer [services] with [key benefits]
- Our pricing is [pricing structure]
- We work with [target customers]

Your task is answering questions about the business & booking meetings.
For meetings: use calendar function to check availability, collect name/email/preferred time, confirm details.

Rules:

- Keep responses short and conversational
- Stay focused on business topics
- Always confirm timezone when discussing meeting times

**Google Calendar Setup:**
1. Enable Google Calendar API in Google Cloud Console
2. Create OAuth2 credentials for N8N
3. Connect your business calendar in the Google Calendar nodes
4. Set correct timezone in both nodes to match your business location

**Website Integration:**
1. Switch chat trigger to "embedded" mode
2. Copy the provided CDN embed code
3. Paste code into your website's HTML (before closing body tag)
4. Replace webhook URL with your production URL

## **Business Use Cases**

- **Service Businesses** - Automate initial consultations and lead qualification
- **Agencies** - Handle project inquiries and schedule discovery calls
- **Consultants** - Streamline the booking process for potential clients
- **E-commerce** - Provide product support and schedule demos
- **Any Business** - Replace contact forms with intelligent conversation

## **Revenue Potential**

This system can replace expensive chatbot services that cost $100-500/month. The automated booking feature alone typically increases meeting conversion rates by 40-60% compared to traditional contact forms.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner  
**Estimated Build Time:** 15-20 minutes  
**Monthly Operating Cost:** ~$10 (OpenAI API usage)
