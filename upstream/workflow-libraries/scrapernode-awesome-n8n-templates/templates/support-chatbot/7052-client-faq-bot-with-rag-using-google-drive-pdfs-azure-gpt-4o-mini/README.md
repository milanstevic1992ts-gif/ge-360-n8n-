## Description

**Description:**

Build your own AI-powered Client FAQ system with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) — fully automated using n8n, Google Drive, and Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini). This no-code automation enables your clients or team to ask questions through a webhook, and get precise answers sourced directly from a collection of PDF documents stored in Google Drive.
Ideal for support teams, sales enablement, onboarding automation, and customer self-service — this RAG-powered bot ensures accurate, document-based answers with no hallucinations or AI guesses.

**What This Template Does (Step-by-Step):**

🌐 Webhook Trigger for Incoming Questions
- Accepts POST requests with a client’s question
- Triggers the entire FAQ automation on request

🗂️ Search Google Drive Folder for Source Documents
- Connects to a specific Google Drive folder (e.g., “Case Studies”)
- Fetches all PDFs to be used as the context source

📥 Downloads and Processes Each File
- Downloads all matched files
- Extracts clean text from each PDF file

🔄 Iterates Over Each File for Text Extraction
- Loops through multiple files
- Extracts relevant content from each file individually

🧠 Prepares Clean Context + Question for RAG
- Combines the extracted PDF text into a single context block
- Injects the user’s question into the RAG-ready prompt

💬 Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini) RAG Prompt
- Generates an accurate answer ONLY from the extracted documents
- If the answer isn’t found, returns a fallback response

📤 Sends the Final Response Back via Webhook
- Returns the AI-generated answer directly to the client via HTTP response

**Perfect For:**

📞 Sales & client onboarding teams
📚 Knowledge base & internal SOP support
🧑‍💻 B2B SaaS customer success teams
🏢 Enterprises automating policy or document queries
💼 Agencies offering client-specific documentation portals
