# What this workflow does?

This is a n8n **Telegram Call In Workflow**. It will wait for message from Telegram bot and sent to the Call Center to process.

# **How it works**

- The **Telegram Trigger** node will wait for the message from the Telegram bot.
- When message is received, it will first check for the matching Member from the PostgreSQL database.
- Then determine if it is a Text message or Voice message.
- For voice message, use the **Google Speech to Text API** to transcript it into text.
- Finally, pass the text to the next flow, i.e. the **Call Center**.
