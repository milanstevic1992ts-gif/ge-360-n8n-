## 🧠 Description

This template deploys an **AI-powered virtual medical secretary** that automates appointment **scheduling, rescheduling, and cancellations** for clinics and healthcare professionals.  
It seamlessly integrates **OpenAI** for natural language understanding, **Google Calendar** for real-time booking, and **Evolution API (WhatsApp)** or **Telegram** for patient communication.

Patients can chat naturally via WhatsApp or Telegram, receiving **empathetic, professional, and human-like responses** — while your calendar stays automatically synchronized in real time.

## 💡 What Problem Does This Solve?

Managing appointments manually is **time-consuming** and **error-prone**, often requiring staff to handle repetitive tasks like checking availability, confirming times, or rescheduling.  
Traditional systems lack conversational capabilities, forcing patients to call or text staff directly.

This template solves that by creating a **conversational AI assistant** that interacts with patients through familiar messaging channels, reducing administrative workload and ensuring accurate real-time scheduling through Google Calendar.
