# What this workflow does?

This is a n8n **Taxi Service Workflow** demo. It is the core node for Taxi Service. It will receive message from the **Call Center Workflow**, handling the QA from the caller, and pass to each of the **Taxi Service Provider Workflow** to process the estimation.

# **How it works**

- The **Flow Trigger** node will wait for the message from **Call Center** or other Sub-workflow.
- When message is received, it will first check for the matching **Service** from the PostgreSQL database.
- If no service or service is inactive, output Error.
- Next, always reset the **Session Data** in Cache, with channel_no set to taxi
- Next, delete the previous **Route Data** in Cache
- Trigger a **AI Agent** to process the fare estimation question to create the **Route Data**
- Use the **Google Map Route API** to calculate the distance.
- Repeat until created the route data, then pass to all the **Taxi Service Provider** for an estimation.
