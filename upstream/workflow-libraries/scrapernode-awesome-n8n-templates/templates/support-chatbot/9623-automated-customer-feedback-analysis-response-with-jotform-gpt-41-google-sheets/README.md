## Description

## AI-powered feedback analysis and response automation from Jotform to Google Sheets and Slack

### Who’s it for  
Businesses using **Jotform** to collect customer feedback who want to automate sentiment analysis, email responses, and internal reporting — especially **eCommerce**, **support**, or **CX teams** looking to scale without hiring more agents.

---

### How it works  
This workflow captures every new Jotform submission, extracts key fields, and uses **OpenAI GPT-4.1** to classify sentiment and root cause.  

- **Negative feedback or ratings ≤3:** Generates a recovery email, logs it in Google Sheets, and alerts your CX team on Slack.  
- **Positive or neutral feedback:** Sends a personalized thank-you email with a link to leave a public review.  

All submissions are stored in Google Sheets for analytics and performance tracking.
