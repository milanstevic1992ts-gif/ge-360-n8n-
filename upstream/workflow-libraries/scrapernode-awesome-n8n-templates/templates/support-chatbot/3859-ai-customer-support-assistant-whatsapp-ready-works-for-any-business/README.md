## Description

**AI Customer-Support Assistant that auto-maps any business site, answers WhatsApp in real time, and lets you earn or save thousands by replacing pricey SaaS chat tools.**

---

### ⚡ What the workflow does

* **Live “AI employee”** - the bot crawls pages on demand (products, policies, FAQs) so you **never** upload documents or fine-tune a model.
* **No-code setup** - Drop in API keys, paste your domain, publish the webhook—ready in \~15 min.
* **Chat memory** - each conversation turn is written to Supabase/Postgres and automatically replayed into the next prompt, letting the assistant remember context so follow-up questions feel natural and coherent even across long sessions.
* **WhatsApp ready** - Free-form replies inside the 24-hour service window, automatically switches to a template when required (recommended by Meta).

### 🛠 5-step setup

1. Import the template into n8n.
2. Add credentials for OpenAI, WhatsApp, and Supabase.

### 🔄 Easy to extend

* **Voice & language** – change wording in the System Prompt.
* **Escalation** – add an “If fallback” branch → Zendesk, email, live agents.
* **Extra channels** – duplicate the reply node for Telegram or Slack.
* **Commerce API hooks** – plug in Shopify, Woo, Stripe for order status or payments.

### 💡 Monetization ideas

* **Replace costly SaaS seats.** Deploy the bot on your own server and *stop paying \$300–\$500 every month* for third-party “AI support” platforms.
* **Sell it as a service.** Spin up a branded instance for local shops, clinics, or e-commerce stores and **charge each client \$300–\$500 per month**—setup time is under 15 minutes.
* Upsell premium coverage (24/7 human hand-off) once the bot handles routine questions.
* Embed product links in answers and earn affiliate or upsell revenue automatically.

Spin it up, connect a domain and a phone number, and you—or your customers—get enterprise-grade support without code, training, or ongoing licence fees.
