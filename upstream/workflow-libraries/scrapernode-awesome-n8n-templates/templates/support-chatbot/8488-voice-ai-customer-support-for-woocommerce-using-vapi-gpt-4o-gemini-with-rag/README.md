# 💬 Voice AI customer support for WooCommerce using VAPI, GPT-4o & Gemini with RAG

> ⚡ **1,185 views** · 💬 [Support Chatbots](../)

## Description

This workflow integrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** with a **post-sales AI agent for WooCommerce**. It combines vector-based search (Qdrant + OpenAI embeddings) with LLMs (Google Gemini and GPT-4o-mini) to provide accurate and contextual responses.

Both systems are connected to **VAPI webhooks**, making the workflow usable in a **voice AI assistant** via **Twilio** phone numbers.

The workflow receives JSON payloads from VAPI via webhooks, processes the request through the appropriate chain (Agent or RAG), and sends a structured response back to VAPI to be read out to the user.

### Advantages

* ✅ **Unified AI Support System**: Combines knowledge retrieval (RAG) with transactional support (WooCommerce).
* ✅ **Data Privacy & Security**: Enforces strict email/order verification before sharing information.
* ✅ **Multi-Model Power**: Leverages both **Google Gemini** and **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** for optimal responses.
* ✅ **Scalable Knowledge Base**: Qdrant vector database ensures fast and accurate context retrieval.
* ✅ **Customer Satisfaction**: Provides real-time answers about orders, tracking, and store policies.
* ✅ **Flexible Integration**: Easily connects with VAPI for **voice assistants** and **phone-based customer support**.
* ✅ **Reusable Components**: The RAG part can be extended for FAQs, while the post-sales agent can scale with more WooCommerce tools.

### How it Works

It has two main components:

1. **RAG System (Knowledge Retrieval & Q\&A)**

   * Uses **OpenAI embeddings** to store documents in **Qdrant**.
   * Retrieves relevant context with a **Vector Store Retriever**.
   * Sends the information to a **Question & Answer Chain** powered by **Google Gemini**.
   * Returns precise, context-based answers to user queries via webhook.

2. **Post-Sales Customer Support Agent**

   * Acts as a **WooCommerce virtual assistant** to:

     * Retrieve customer orders (`get_order`, `get_orders`).
     * Get user profiles (`get_user`).
     * Provide **shipment tracking** (`get_tracking`) using YITH WooCommerce Order Tracking plugin.
   * Enforces **strict verification rules**: customer email must match the order before disclosing details.
   * Communicates professionally, providing clear and secure customer support.
   * Integrates with **GPT-4o-mini** for natural conversation flow.

### **Set Up Steps**

To implement this workflow, follow these three main steps:

**1. Infrastructure & Credentials Setup in n8n:**
*   Ensure all required nodes have their credentials configured:
    *   **OpenAI API Key:** For the `GPT 4o-mini` and `Embeddings OpenAI` nodes.
    *   **Google Gemini API Key:** For the `Google Gemini Chat Model` node.
    *   **Qdrant Connection Details:** For the `Qdrant Vector Store1` node (points to a Hetzner server).
    *   **WooCommerce API Keys:** For the `get_order`, `get_orders`, and `get_user` nodes (for `magnanigioielli.com`).
    *   **WordPress HTTP Auth Credentials:** For the `Get tracking` node in the sub-workflow.
*   **Pre-populate the Vector Database:** The RAG system requires a pre-filled Qdrant collection with your store's knowledge base (e.g., policy documents, product info). The "Sticky Note2" provides a link to a guide on building this RAG system.

**2. Workflow Activation in n8n:**
*   Save this JSON workflow in your n8n instance.
*   **Activate the workflow.** This is crucial, as n8n only listens for webhook triggers when the workflow is active.
*   Note the unique public webhook URLs generated for the `Webhook` (post-sales agent) and `rag` (RAG system) nodes. You will need these URLs for the next step.

**3. VAPI Configuration:**
*   **Create Two API Tools in VAPI:**
    *   **Tool 1 (Post-Sales):** Create an "API Request" tool. Connect it to the n8n `Webhook` URL. Configure the request body to send parameters `email` and `n_order` based on the conversation with the user.
    *   **Tool 2 (RAG):** Create another "API Request" tool. Connect it to the n8n `rag` webhook URL. Configure the request body to send a `search` parameter containing the user's query.
*   **Build the Assistant:** Create a new assistant in VAPI. Write a system prompt that instructs the AI on when to use each of the two tools you created. In the "Tools" tab, add both tools.
*   **Go Live:** Add a phone number (e.g., from Twilio) to your VAPI assistant and set it to "Inbound" to receive customer calls.
