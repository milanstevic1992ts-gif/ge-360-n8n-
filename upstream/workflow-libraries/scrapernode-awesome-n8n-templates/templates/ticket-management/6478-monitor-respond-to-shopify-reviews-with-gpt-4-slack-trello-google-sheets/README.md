## Description

# ⚙️ How It Works

This workflow is a **comprehensive, AI-powered system** that transforms customer feedback into strategic business intelligence.  
It operates in a multi-stage process to ensure every review or mention is handled proactively and intelligently.

## 🔊 Multi-Channel Listening
- Triggers monitor platforms like **Shopify**, **Twitter**, and more for new reviews or mentions.

## 🧠 AI-Powered Analysis
- When feedback is detected, it's sent to an **OpenAI node**.  
  The AI performs:
  - **Sentiment analysis**: Positive, Negative, or Neutral  
  - **Scoring & categorization** (e.g., Shipping, Product Quality)  
  - **Urgency assessment** to prioritize response

## 🔀 Smart Conditional Logic
- An `If` node evaluates sentiment and urgency  
- The workflow branches into **customized response paths**

## 🚨 Automated Escalation
- Negative or high-urgency feedback triggers:
  - **Slack alerts** to the appropriate team channel  
  - **Trello or Asana tasks** for rapid issue resolution

## 📊 Centralized Logging
- All feedback + AI analysis is logged in **Google Sheets**  
- Enables long-term trend analysis and strategic decision-making

## 💬 Proactive Engagement
- Positive reviews trigger a **"Thank You" email**  
- Strengthens customer loyalty and boosts brand trust
