# 🎫 Xano Support Ticket Router (AI + Xano Node Integration)

> ⚡ **25 views** · 🎫 [Ticket Management & Triage](../)

## Description

This template demonstrates how to combine **n8n**, **OpenAI agents**, and the new **Xano Node** to build an intelligent support-ticket routing system — without writing a single API call.

Start your Xano journey with the downloadable snippet [here!](https://www.xano.com/snippet/SABJTqr-)

When a ticket arrives, the workflow:

1. **Receives the ticket** via Webhook
2. **Classifies the issue** using an n8n Agent with an OpenAI model
3. **Searches Xano** to check whether the user already exists
4. **Creates or updates records** using the native Xano Node (no headers or manual HTTP setup)
5. **Triggers backend logic in Xano**, where escalation rules and agent workflows process the ticket
6. **Returns a structured response** to n8n for further routing (Slack, CRM, inbox, etc.)

This template highlights how Xano can act as your backend intelligence layer while n8n orchestrates everything else — making it easy to automate support operations, apply escalation policies, and unify your data across tools.

Use this as a foundation to build more advanced automation: customer enrichment, billing checks, account risk detection, SLA enforcement, and more.

Happy building! 🚀
